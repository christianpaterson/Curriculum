                      Yeah so we’ve got atoms, which are what they sound like as
                      long as you’ve made it past 7th grade. The organization of
                      a typical atom has a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and
                      electrons orbiting outside, probabilistically located
                      somewhere within different energy levels, or orbitals.
                      Electrons are far less massive (1/1836) than protons. They
                      have higher energy (and thus greater velocity) the farther
                      they are from the nucleus. Electrons have electric
                      potential energy due to their charge, lower when they are
                      closer to the nucleus, and more when they are farther
                      away. Charged particles create an electric field around
                      themselves. This field exerts forces on other charged
                      particles within its influence. The electric potential
                      energy of a charged particle (electron or proton) is
                      determined by its position within this electric field. The
                      energy decreases as the particle moves farther from
                      similarly charged particles and closer to oppositely
                      charged particles. This energy depends on the charge of
                      the particle, the distance between charges, and the
                      strength of the electric field. Electrons exist in
                      discrete energy levels around the nucleus of an atom,
                      which are defined by quantum mechanics. They are most
                      likely found in regions called orbitals, and their precise
                      positions cannot be determined exactly. The electrons
                      moving throughout whatever conducting material are the
                      valence electrons (the same ones which form covalent bonds
                      in other contexts). If current is flowing, some electrons
                      in the outer shells of atoms are moving through the
                      material. Metals overall will still maintain a neutral
                      charge though (almost always, and if not, then it is
                      usually only brief moments that they as a whole are
                      charged). So there are NOT usually more electrons within
                      the metal than could theoretically be captured within all
                      the atoms of the metal. But there very well may be more
                      free electrons than electrons associating with one
                      particular atom. Put another way, while there are more
                      free electrons than protons in a localized region within a
                      metal when an electric field is applied, this does not
                      imply that the entire metal has a net negative charge
                      (static electricity). Electrons continuously move and
                      redistribute themselves as the current flows, but the
                      overall balance of charge within the metal remains neutral
                      (charge conservation).
