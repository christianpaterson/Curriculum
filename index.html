          <p>
            So once upon a time, I decided that in order to be a real software
            engineer, and in preparation for a Computer Organization class and
            Computer Networking class, I needed to understand the deep down, the
            under the hood shit. I thought I would start with electricity. How
            complex could it be, really? But as it turns out, everything is
            related to, and dependent on, everything else. There is no natural
            end to learning, and we have to have some rigid borders in place so
            that we don’t accidentally fall into other “fields.” Unless we plan
            on learning forever, that is. Curiosity doesn't care about fields,
            or areas of study, and we really will go on forever if we just
            continually ask the next burning question.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I do! Because I am a serious and responsible adult. I care about
            fields. Because I like staying alive and eating food, and I want a
            job. So follow me as I learn these concepts, becoming intensely
            curious, yet being super disciplined and not getting distracted at
            all.
          </p>

          <p>So let’s take the first topic which started it all—electricity.</p>

          <p>
            Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter, standing
            alongside other heavy-hitters such as: Mass, Volume, Density,
            Magnetism, Temperature, State of Matter, Chemical Composition,
            Melting/Boiling Point, Conductivity, Atomic Number, Atomic Mass,
            Solubility, Refractive Index, Electronegativity, pH, Ductility,
            Tensile Strength, Brittleness, Malleability, Elasticity, Viscosity,
            Specific Heat Capacity, Vapor Pressure, Chemical Reactivity,
            Chemical Stability, Electrical Resistivity, Radioactivity,
            Superconductivity, Thermal Expansion…
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of all the knowledge juice we could squeeze from these topics…
            Nope! We’re sticking with electric charge. Electricity gives life to
            our tech, and I am a serious tech guy who has the ability to stay on
            topic. This is a valid area of study, and I don’t need to know
            everything about everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will drill into the workings of electricity with exacting focus,
            and then swiftly move on to even more actionable topics in computer
            science.

          <p>
            Now, if we’re going to learn about electricity, the laws of our
            universe would have it that we should start with the concept of
            voltage. And we will get right to it, right after we make sure we
            have gained at least a cursory understanding of the basic chemistry
            which defines an atom’s organization, and the way electrons behave.
            It shouldn’t take long…
          </p>

          <p>
            We’ve all looked at a Jimmy Neutron-style model of an atom, which
            looks pretty cool and gets the idea across decently well. Nacho
            Libre taught us more memorably than any science class what a nucleus
            is all about, so I won’t spend much time here other than to mention
            that inside a nucleus, we have the more interesting protons and
            neutrons.
          </p>

          <p>
            And we know that electrons zip around on the outside. But to be
            honest, if we really want to understand how our computers work, its
            not enough to just accept that there are neutrons, protons, and
            electrons, and everything is made up of these things. In fact,
            everything is not made of these things. There is more, there is much
            more.
          </p>

          <p>
            The story doesn’t end with Nacho and Jimmy, not even close. We can
            go so much deeper, and we should. These friendly and familiar
            characters of “neutron,” “proton,” and “electron” can get
            exponentially more frustrating to understand if we look a bit
            closer.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can totally grasp the fullness of subatomic particles, in like, 5
            minutes tops. Then back to electricity and computer science!

              <p>Neutrons &amp; Protons</p>
              <p>
                So neutrons and protons are not as straightforward as they seem.
                They are both baryons, a type of hadron (which is a type of
                fermion). They are made up of quarks, and stuck together with
                gluons (a type of boson).
              </p>
              <p>Get fucking ready!!</p>
              <p>
                Let’s explain that mess above. Neutrons and protons are Baryons,
                a type of composite particle made up of 3 quarks and 3
                antiquarks. What are quarks? Now is not the time, not just yet,
                to go into them.
              </p>
              <p>The Baryons</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Proton (uud)</li>
                <li>Neutron (udd)</li>
                <li>Lambda Baryon (uds)</li>
                <li>Sigma Baryons (Σ+ and others)</li>
                <li>Xi Baryons (Ξ0 and others)</li>
                <li>Omega Baryon (Ω-)</li>
              </ol>

              <p>And the list goes on…</p>

              <p>
                Now baryons are a type of Hadron, which can be defined as
                particles that are subject to the strong nuclear force and made
                up of quarks.
              </p>

              <p>
                The other main type of hadrons are the mesons, also composite,
                made up of 1 quark and 1 antiquark:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Pions (π+, π0, π-)</li>
                <li>Kaons (K+, K0, K-)</li>
                <li>Eta Meson (η)</li>
                <li>J/psi Meson (J/ψ)</li>
                <li>Phi Meson (φ)</li>
                <li>D Mesons (D+, D0, D-)</li>
                <li>B Mesons (B+, B0, B-)</li>
              </ol>

              <p>And the list goes on…</p>
              <p>
                Now mesons are of course hadrons, because we just said they were
                and because 1) they are composed of quarks and antiquarks and 2)
                they are held together by the strong nuclear force. But they can
                also be considered Bosons, which, as you’ll see, is strange.
              </p>

              <p>
                We’ll get more into bosons later, but for now know that they
                obey Bose-Einstein statistics, allowing multiple bosons to
                occupy the same quantum state without restriction. Mesons do
                this, which again, is not what you would expect. Mesons also
                exhibit bosonic behavior because they have integer spin values
                (0 or 1) and do not obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which is
                characteristic of fermions. Fermions? We will get to them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now the Quarks themselves are elementary particles which means
                that as far as we know they are not composed of smaller
                constituents. I suspect even this we cannot be sure of, but
                onwards..
              </p>

              <p>
                Quarks are never found in isolation but combine to form the
                hadrons explored above. There are six known flavors of quarks:
                up, down, STRANGE, CHARM, bottom, and top. They interact via the
                strong nuclear force, which holds atomic nuclei together. Up,
                top, and charm quarks have a charge of +2/3, while down, bottom,
                and strange quarks have a charge of -1/3 in terms of elementary
                charge (e).
              </p>

              <p>
                Quarks are also part of a larger category of elementary
                particles which are said to make up all of matter: the Fermions.
                Matter as we understand it is only and exclusively made up of
                fermions. Dissect any piece of matter anywhere, and at bottom
                you will only find fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion
                Principle, which means no two fermions can occupy the same
                quantum state simultaneously.
              </p>

              <p>
                So quarks, and all the hadrons we discussed, are all fermions.
                Thus fermions can be either elementary or composite. And besides
                the quarks, there is one other broad category of elementary
                fermions: the leptons.
              </p>

              <p>The Leptons</p>

              <p>
                Leptons are a group of elementary particles that include
                electrons, muons, and tauons, along with their associated
                neutrinos and antineutrinos (so 9 particles in total). They do
                not participate in the strong nuclear force and are known for
                their weak interactions with matter.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, within the fermions, in addition to the 6 quarks and
                everything they can make, we have the Leptons:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Electron (e⁻)</li>
                <li>Electron Neutrino (νe)</li>
                <li>Muon (μ⁻)</li>
                <li>Muon Neutrino (νμ)</li>
                <li>Tauon (τ⁻)</li>
                <li>Tau Neutrino (ντ)</li>
                <li>Electron Antineutrino (νe̅)</li>
                <li>Muon Antineutrino (νμ̅)</li>
                <li>Tau Antineutrino (ντ̅)</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Neutrinos are lightweight, with a mass that is not precisely
                known, but much smaller than that of electrons or other
                subatomic particles. They can pass through vast amounts of
                matter, including the Earth, with minimal interaction. Neutrinos
                are incredibly abundant in the universe—trillions of neutrinos
                from the Sun pass through your body every second, yet they
                rarely interact with your atoms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Neutrinos exhibit Flavor Oscillation, wherein they change from
                one of their three flavors (νe, νμ, ντ) to another as they
                travel through space. This discovery led to the understanding
                that neutrinos have a small but non-zero mass, contrary to
                earlier theories.
              </p>

              <p>
                Neutrinos primarily interact via the weak nuclear force, making
                them challenging to detect. And they are electrically neutral,
                which allows them to interact very weakly with matter through
                the electromagnetic force.
              </p>

              <p>
                Neutrinos are produced in various astrophysical processes,
                including nuclear reactions in stars, supernovae, and cosmic ray
                interactions with the Earth's atmosphere. We use large
                underground detectors or detectors deep within ice or water, to
                capture neutrino interactions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Neutrinos are left-handed, meaning they preferentially interact
                with particles spinning in a particular direction (spin angular
                momentum).
              </p>

              <p>
                Onto the next one! A Muon (μ⁻) is a heavier cousin of the
                electron, with similar properties but greater mass. They behave
                similarly in terms of their charge and interactions with
                electromagnetic fields. They are often produced in high-energy
                particle interactions, such as those that occur in particle
                accelerators or cosmic ray showers. As far as we know, muons are
                unstable and relatively short-lived particles, existing only
                briefly before decaying into other particles.
              </p>

              <p>
                Taus or Tauons (τ-) are the negatively charged particles
                associated with the tau lepton. The tau is significantly heavier
                than both the electron and the muon. It has a mass of
                approximately 1,777 times that of the electron. The tau has a
                relatively short lifetime compared to the electron and the muon.
                It typically lives for about 2.9 x 10^-13 seconds before
                decaying into other particles. When a tau particle decays, it
                can produce various particles, including other leptons (muons or
                electrons) and neutrinos.
              </p>

              <p>
                Like all leptons, taus interact via the weak nuclear force and
                gravity but not via the strong nuclear force. And like muons,
                taus are typically produced in high-energy particle
                interactions, such as those occurring in particle accelerators
                or cosmic ray interactions with Earth's atmosphere.
              </p>

              <p>
                All three neutrinos share key similarities in contrast with
                their corresponding charged lepton cousins. For example, charged
                leptons have finite lifetimes and can decay into other
                particles. Neutrinos, on the other hand, are typically stable
                and do not decay under normal circumstances. Neutrinos interact
                very weakly with matter as opposed to the charged leptons, which
                interact electromagnetically and have much stronger interactions
                with matter.
              </p>

              <p>So those are the fermions. Now let’s get even weirder.</p>

              <p>The Bosons.</p>

              <p>
                Bosons are elementary particles. They are considered fundamental
                and not composed of smaller constituents. Bosons are one of the
                three major categories of elementary particles, along with
                fermions (which include quarks and leptons).
              </p>

              <p>
                They are not considered matter particles because they do not
                constitute the substance of physical matter. Instead, bosons are
                associated with the transmission of forces and interactions
                between matter particles, such as electromagnetism, the weak
                nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. They are force
                carrier particles or mediators of fundamental forces in the
                universe.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first, and larger, category of Bosons are Gauge Bosons (or
                Vector Bosons). These are the bosons with the familiar
                attributes described above, being associated with fundamental
                forces and being responsible for mediating the interactions
                between particles.
              </p>

              <p>
                And within the Gauge Bosons, each fundamental force in the
                universe is associated with specific bosons, all of which are
                also considered to be Force Carrier Bosons:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Photons (γ) are massless bosons responsible for mediating the
                  electromagnetic force. They are the smallest units of
                  electromagnetic radiation, and carry electromagnetic
                  interaction between charged particles. They are elementary
                  particles of light encompass all forms of light, from radio
                  waves to gamma rays. They have no mass and do not make up
                  matter, so they always move at the speed of light in a vacuum.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Photons carry discrete packets of energy, which for each
                  photon is directly proportional to its frequency (E = hf). H
                  is Planck’s constant. They always travel in straight lines
                  when moving through a homogeneous medium. They are
                  electrically neutral. They can be absorbed or emitted by
                  electrons in atoms and molecules.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                I could go on and on about photons, but I’ll just mention one
                last interesting computer-relevant fact instead. So photons are
                responsible for many forms of radiation, such as UV, X-rays, and
                gamma rays. In the context of computers, it’s interesting to
                note that a simple X-ray can flip bits in electronic devices.
                This phenomenon is known as a "soft error" or "single-event
                upset" (SEU).
              </p>

              <p>
                When high-energy photons, such as X-rays or gamma rays, pass
                through electronic devices, they can create electron-hole pairs
                in semiconductor materials. This process is known as ionization.
                The free electrons and holes created by ionization can migrate
                through the semiconductor material, potentially reaching
                sensitive regions of transistors or memory cells. If these free
                charges reach a critical location, they can temporarily alter
                the charge state of a transistor or memory cell. This can lead
                to a "bit flip" or an error in the stored data.
              </p>

              <p>
                Soft errors are more likely to occur in space environments, at
                high altitudes, or in areas with high levels of ionizing
                radiation, such as near nuclear reactors. In everyday use, the
                likelihood is very low due to protective measures such as
                error-correcting code (ECC) memory and shielding.
              </p>

              <p>
                Anyways, back to the bosons! W and Z Bosons (W⁺, W⁻, Z⁰) are
                massive bosons responsible for mediating the weak nuclear force,
                which governs certain types of nuclear interactions and
                especially decays. The distinction between matter and non-matter
                particles can be nuanced, especially when considering massive
                bosons.
              </p>

              <p>
                By the way, in a broader sense, “matter particles” often refer
                to fermions (quarks and leptons), which make up the matter in
                the universe. However, massive bosons like the W and Z bosons do
                interact with matter particles and play a crucial role in the
                behavior of particles in the universe.
              </p>

              <p>
                Gluons (g) are massless bosons responsible for mediating the
                strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together to form
                hadrons. In other words, they are the force carriers of the
                strong nuclear force, which binds together protons and neutrons,
                making them integral to the structure of atomic nuclei. Gluons
                are considered subatomic particles and elementary particles.
              </p>

              <p>
                Being massless, gluons travel at the speed of light and interact
                with quarks and other gluons to convey the strong force. This
                force is what keeps quarks tightly bound within hadrons and
                prevents them from existing in isolation, a phenomenon known as
                quark confinement. Gluons play a vital role in the theory of
                quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the behavior of
                quarks and the strong force.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second category of bosons are the Scalar Bosons. The Higgs
                Boson is the only Scalar Boson. The Higgs boson is unique in its
                role, as it is associated with the Higgs field and the mechanism
                responsible for giving mass to other particles. It doesn’t fit
                into the category of gauge bosons that mediate forces. Its
                discovery in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was a major
                breakthrough in particle physics.
              </p>

              <p>
                And so, in review, composite subatomic particles include
                neutrons, protons, baryons, and mesons. Elementary subatomic
                particles include electrons, quarks, muons, tau, neutrinos, and
                bosons such as photons, gluons, W Z bosons, and the Higgs boson.
              </p>

              <p>
                But there are remaining complexities to explore. To start, let
                us look at bosons and Bose-Einstein statistics.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unlike fermions which obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle and
                cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, bosons
                follow Bose-Einstein statistics. This means multiple bosons can
                occupy the same quantum state without restriction, leading to
                phenomena like Bose-Einstein Condensates in ultra-cold physics.
                Let’s explore what that is!
              </p>

              <p>Bose-Einstein Condensates</p>

              <p>
                A Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) is a fascinating and exotic
                state of matter that occurs at extremely low temperatures, close
                to absolute zero, typically just a few billionths of a degree
                above 0 Kelvin. This extreme cooling is necessary to slow down
                the thermal motion of particles and allow them to occupy the
                lowest energy quantum state. In extreme conditions such as a
                BEC, atoms can collectively behave as bosons.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, a large number of bosonic particles, typically atoms, occupy
                the same quantum state and behave as a single, coherent quantum
                entity. They are often superfluid, which means they flow without
                any viscosity or resistance. This property is a result of all
                the particles being in the same quantum state and behaving
                collectively. Particles in a BEC are in a state of quantum
                coherence, meaning their wave functions overlap, and they act as
                a single quantum entity rather than individual particles.
              </p>

              <p>
                BECs exhibit Macroscopic Quantum on a scale visible to the naked
                eye. For example, when you look at this blob, you might see
                something quite unusual. When you let it expand, it doesn’t
                behave like everyday matter. Instead, it spreads out in a way
                that looks like ripples in a pond when you throw a stone. These
                patterns are a sign that all the particles are acting together
                in a very “quantum” way.
              </p>

              <p>
                BECs have been a subject of intense research in the field of
                atomic physics. They have applications in quantum computing and
                the study of quantum phase transitions, both of which we will
                look at in depth because I am hopeless.
              </p>

              <p>More Subatomic Particles</p>

              <p>
                Now, if your brain isn’t hurting yet, consider that Bosons can
                also decay into other particles. For instance, W and Z bosons
                can decay into myriad combinations of quarks and leptons. Many
                subatomic particles do weird counterintuitive stuff like this.
                And remember, these are elementary particles. These are what
                make up everything. And they are a bunch of interesting
                characters. For example, further consider that each subatomic
                particle has a corresponding antiparticle with the opposite
                charge. The antiparticle of an electron is called a positron.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are particles called anyons, which are neither fermions
                nor bosons. Statistically, they are neither Fermi-Dirac nor
                Bose-Einstein. Anyons have unique quantum properties and occur
                in certain exotic physical systems. And lastly, just in case you
                think you understand our world, I assure you that pages and
                pages could be filled with additional elementary particles, many
                only yet theoretical, such as the graviton, which would be a
                boson associated with gravity if we could prove it exists.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally, we will get back to electricity. This was totally
                necessary for me to know. I’m capable of getting right back on
                topic. I am a responsible adult.

                    Well, not quite. Now that we understand subatomic particles,
                    let’s briefly (briefly!) visit the world of quantum
                    mechanics and quantum computing. Quantum mechanics, at its
                    core, is probabilistic. It provides probabilities for
                    different outcomes rather than deterministic predictions. In
                    practical terms, this means that I am about to say a bunch
                    of things that sound like contradictions. Happy reading :)
                  </p>

                  <p>The Basics</p>

                  <p>
                    First off, most of you have undoubtedly heard that
                    everything is both a wave and a particle, if we get teeny
                    tiny enough. This is because subatomic particles can exhibit
                    both wave-like behaviors, such as interference and
                    diffraction, as well as particle behavior, like localized
                    positions. This wave-particle duality is especially
                    pronounced in particles with low mass (but not too low!).
                    Electrons display this property more than neutrinos
                    (incredibly light), and more than protons (relatively
                    heavy).
                  </p>

                  <p>Quantum States and Observables</p>

                  <p>
                    Not only can a particle be also a wave, but it can exist in
                    multiple “quantum states.” Quantum states describe the
                    fundamental properties of particles or systems in quantum
                    mechanics. They are represented by wave functions, which
                    contain information about a particle's position, momentum,
                    and other observables. Quantum states can be superposed,
                    meaning particles can exist in multiple states
                    simultaneously until measured. We will return to wave
                    functions below.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Observables in quantum mechanics are physical properties or
                    quantities that can be measured, such as position, momentum,
                    energy, or spin. Confusingly, when a measurement is made,
                    the observable collapses the quantum state into one of its
                    possible eigenstates, yielding a definite value for the
                    measured property. This is known as the “observer effect” or
                    “measurement collapse.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When a quantum system is in a superposition of states
                    (existing in multiple states simultaneously), making a
                    measurement causes the system to “collapse” into one of
                    those possible states with certain probabilities. The
                    specific outcome is not determined until the measurement is
                    made.
                  </p>

                  <p>Complex Numbers and Wave Functions</p>

                  <p>
                    Complex numbers extend the real number system by adding an
                    imaginary unit (i = the square root of -1) to it. They are
                    written in the form a + bi. Complex numbers are used in
                    quantum mechanics to represent the probability amplitudes
                    associated with quantum states.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Because complex numbers allow for the representation of both
                    magnitude and phase information, they are able to represent
                    wave functions. Wave functions describe the quantum state of
                    a particle, such as an electron, and often need to include
                    magnitude and phase.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This is useful for physicists because within a wave
                    function, these same complex numbers represent probability
                    amplitudes, which are squared to obtain actual
                    probabilities. Complex numbers within wave functions must
                    satisfy normalization conditions to ensure that the total
                    probability of finding the particle in any state equals 1.
                    Lastly, wave functions can describe superposition, wherein
                    particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with
                    its own complex probability amplitude.
                  </p>

                  <p>The Schrödinger Equation</p>

                  <p>
                    The Schrödinger Equation is a fundamental equation in
                    quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a
                    physical system evolves over time. The Schrödinger Equation
                    is used to model the behavior of quantum bits or qubits in a
                    quantum computer.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum algorithms manipulate qubits through quantum gates,
                    and the Schrödinger Equation governs how these qubits evolve
                    during computations. Quantum computers leverage principles
                    like superposition and entanglement, described by the
                    Schrödinger Equation, to perform certain calculations
                    exponentially faster than classical computers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's
                    algorithm, exploit these quantum properties to solve complex
                    problems more efficiently.
                  </p>

                  <p>You’re Not Ready For Quantum Entanglement</p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics
                    where two or more particles become interconnected in such a
                    way that the state of one particle is instantly correlated
                    with the state of another, regardless of the distance
                    separating them. This correlation occurs even if the
                    particles are light-years apart.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In the context of quantum computing, quantum entanglement
                    can be thought of as a resource that quantum computers can
                    use to perform certain computations more efficiently than
                    classical computers. For example, when qubits enter an
                    entangled state, it introduces an additional level of
                    quantum correlation that can offer unique advantages.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Entanglement allows qubits to be in a state where the
                    outcome of one qubit's measurement is instantly correlated
                    with the outcome of another, regardless of the distance
                    between them. This means that operations performed on one
                    qubit can immediately affect the state of another, enabling
                    a form of parallelism that is not achievable with
                    unentangled qubits, and of course not remotely plausible
                    with classical bits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum algorithms designed to exploit entanglement can
                    provide computational speedups that go beyond what is
                    achievable with non-entangled qubits alone. And certain
                    quantum algorithms, like Shor's algorithm for factoring
                    large numbers or quantum teleportation, heavily rely on
                    entanglement to achieve their remarkable computational
                    advantages. These algorithms wouldn't be as efficient or
                    powerful without entanglement.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Entanglement is harnessed through quantum gates and
                    operations. In addition to EVEN faster computing speeds and
                    even greater parallelism, entanglement allows quantum
                    computers to perform tasks like quantum teleportation of
                    quantum key distribution, which have practical applications
                    in secure communication.

                  <p>
                    Quantum teleportation sounds like straight up sci-fi. Let's
                    dive in. It is a quantum algorithm and a communication
                    protocol that allows the quantum state of one particle (one
                    qubit) to be transmitted to another, distant particle,
                    effectively "teleporting" the information contained within
                    the state. This process occurs instantaneously, without
                    physical transfer of the particle itself, and it occurs
                    while preserving the particle's quantum properties.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum teleportation relies on a combination of
                    entanglement, Bell measurement, and classical communication
                    to transfer quantum information accurately. Quantum
                    teleportation enables the secure and instantaneous
                    transmission of quantum information over long distances.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum teleportation and other methods which utilize
                    entanglement are crucial for building the future internet
                    and future cryptography systems via quantum mechanics.
                    Without entanglement, quantum computers would lose possibly
                    their most powerful feature. And yet even without it, they
                    would still remain mind-bendingly faster than our already
                    mind-bendingly fast and complex computers.

                  <p>
                    Scientists can create entanglement deliberately by applying
                    specific quantum operations or gates to a group of qubits.
                    These operations can be designed to generate entangled
                    states among the qubits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    What? In order to understand this, let’s explain qubits,
                    quantum gates, and quantum operations.
                  </p>

                  <p>Qubits</p>

                  <p>
                    Qubits are quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information
                    in quantum computing and quantum information theory. Qubits
                    can represent 0, 1, or both (superposition). Their existence
                    in the 0 and 1 states simultaneously allows them to perform
                    multiple calculations in parallel, providing a computational
                    advantage over classical bits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As mentioned above, qubits can become entangled with each
                    other, creating strong correlations between their states.
                    Changes to one qubit instantly affect the other, even when
                    separated by large distances. When measured, a qubit
                    collapses from its superposition state into one of the
                    classical states (0 or 1) with a certain probability
                    determined by the coefficients in its superposition.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Qubits can be implemented using a variety of quantum systems
                    and technologies, each with its own set of advantages and
                    challenges. Let’s explore. First off, qubits can be created
                    using superconducting electrical circuits cooled to
                    extremely low temperatures. These circuits exhibit quantized
                    energy levels, making them suitable for quantum computing.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    What are quantized energy levels? They are discrete and
                    specific energy values that certain quantum systems can
                    have. In quantum mechanics, energy is not continuous but
                    rather comes in discrete "chunks" or levels. In these
                    systems, energy can only take on certain well-defined
                    values, often called energy quanta.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    One of the most famous examples of quantized energy levels
                    is the energy levels of electrons in atoms. Remember
                    orbitals? Electrons can only transition between these states
                    by absorbing or emitting discrete amounts of energy in the
                    form of photons.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Another example is the fact that photons themselves, as
                    particles of light, also have quantized energy levels. The
                    energy of a photon is directly proportional to its
                    frequency, and the energy levels of photons are quantized
                    according to the Planck-Einstein relation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This quantization of energy is in contrast to classical
                    physics, where energy levels are continuous. And it is taken
                    advantage of via superconducting circuits by companies such
                    as IBM and Google, who use these kinds of qubits in their
                    quantum processors.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Other types of qubits include trapped ions, quantum dots,
                    photons, and nuclear magnetic resonance NMR. Let’s take them
                    one at a time. First off, trapping individual ions (charged
                    atoms) and manipulating them using electromagnetic fields
                    allows us to represent the internal energy levels of these
                    ions as the qubit states. Trapped ion qubits are known for
                    their long coherence times and high fidelity.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Even crazier, quantum dots are tiny semiconductor structures
                    that can trap single electrons. The spin of the trapped
                    electron can be used as a qubit. Photons, as particles of
                    light, can also represent qubits. They can be manipulated
                    using optical components to create quantum states. Photons
                    are well-suited for quantum communication and quantum key
                    distribution.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    And lastly, nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) qubits are
                    based on the nuclear spins of atoms within a molecule. NMR
                    techniques can manipulate these spins to create and control
                    qubits. NMR quantum computers are often used for educational
                    purposes.
                  </p>

                  <p>Quantum Gates</p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum gates are the quantum equivalent to classical logic
                    gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR). They are fundamental
                    building blocks of quantum circuits, performing operations
                    on qubits and allowing for the manipulation and
                    transformation of quantum states. Quantum gates are unitary,
                    meaning they preserve the normalization of quantum states
                    and are reversible. This reversibility is a fundamental
                    property of quantum operations, ensuring that no information
                    is lost during quantum computation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Single-qubit gates operate on individual qubits. They can
                    perform operations like changing the phase, rotating the
                    qubit's state on the Bloch sphere, or applying a Pauli-X,
                    Pauli-Y, or Pauli-Z operation. Examples of single-qubit
                    gates include the Hadamard gate (H), the Pauli-X gate (X),
                    and the phase gate (S).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Two-qubit gates operate on pairs of qubits and are used to
                    create entanglement or perform controlled operations. The
                    most famous two-qubit gate is the CNOT gate, which is
                    essential for creating and manipulating entangled states.
                    There’s a lot to talk about here.
                  </p>

                  <p>CNOT GATE WIZARDRY</p>

                  <p>How does the CNOT Gate endure entanglement?</p>

                  <p>
                    The CNOT gate, short for Controlled-NOT gate, operates on a
                    control qubit and a target qubit. The control qubit
                    determines whether an operation is applied to the target
                    qubit based on its state.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The CNOT gate performs a NOT operation on the target qubit
                    if and only if the control qubit is in the state of 1. If
                    the control qubit is in the state 0, the target qubit
                    remains unchanged. When the control qubit is in a
                    superposition of 0 and 1 states, and a CNOT gate is applied,
                    it entangles the control and target qubits. This means that
                    the combined state of the two qubits becomes an entangled
                    state.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But why? Well, when a qubit is in a superposition, it means
                    it exists in a combination of multiple states
                    simultaneously. And remember, the CNOT gate is controlled by
                    one qubit (control) while acting on another qubit (target).
                    So what is done to the target depends on a state which may
                    be indeterminable. Let’s take an analogy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Imagine your spouse is the one with the real eye for travel.
                    They know where to go, and how to plan a trip. At the end of
                    the day, they control if you go or not, and where, and how.
                    But it’s not so simple and one-sided, because you are the
                    breadwinner. Deep down it is your wealth which also
                    determines whether you can go, and where. You are the target
                    of persuasion.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So again if the control is a 1, your spouse has their eye on
                    somewhere great, and they are excited about it. Thus they
                    can persuade you to spend the money, and the trip is had.
                    But if the control qubit is in the state 0, the target qubit
                    remains unchanged. In other words, your spouse did not have
                    a grand idea, or they weren’t sold on it just yet.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now, let us see where this analogy grows some real corn. If
                    the control qubit is in a superposition of 0 and 1 states,
                    and a CNOT gate is applied, it entangles the control and
                    target qubits. If your spouse is going crazy with
                    indecision, and cannot decide between two trips, you will
                    surely be brought in. You are entangled.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    And so the combined state of the two qubits becomes an
                    entangled state, a state that can't be described
                    independently. Your spouse is sure of something, but not the
                    details, as they usually are. So you are bound together in
                    the decision-making process.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The key to entanglement here lies in the fact that the
                    control qubit is in a superposition of both 0 and 1. This
                    means that, in a sense, the CNOT gate is applied to both
                    possibilities simultaneously.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In physics this is known as a Bell state, and it's entangled
                    because you can't describe the state of one qubit without
                    considering the state of the other. Measuring one qubit
                    instantly tells you the state of the other, no matter how
                    far apart they are. This is what makes entanglement a
                    non-classical phenomenon.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Entangled states generated by CNOT gates are essential in
                    quantum computing algorithms and quantum communication
                    protocols. They enable quantum computers to perform certain
                    computations more efficiently and facilitate secure quantum
                    key distribution for cryptography.
                  </p>

                  <p>Other Quantum Gates</p>

                  <p>
                    We should also mention that quantum circuits can involve
                    gates that operate on more than two qubits simultaneously,
                    allowing for complex interactions and computations, and that
                    quantum algorithms are constructed using sequences of
                    quantum gates. These algorithms exploit quantum
                    superposition and entanglement to solve specific problems
                    faster than classical algorithms.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Many quantum gates can be expressed as combinations of
                    simpler gates. This gate decomposition allows for efficient
                    implementations on quantum hardware and is a key aspect of
                    quantum compiler tools.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum gates are also integral to quantum error correction
                    codes, where logical qubits are encoded in a larger group of
                    physical qubits. Quantum gates are used to detect and
                    correct errors that can occur in quantum computations due to
                    noise and decoherence.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum gates can also be called quantum operations, which
                    again include the Pauli-X gate (bit flip), Pauli-Y gate (bit
                    and phase flip), Pauli-Z gate (phase flip), Hadamard gate
                    (superposition creation), and the CNOT gate (controlled-X
                    gate for entanglement).
                  </p>

                  <p>Quantum Operators</p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum operators are mathematical objects that represent
                    transformations in quantum mechanics. These operators can be
                    applied to quantum states to calculate observable quantities
                    or evolve the state of a quantum system over time.
                    Observables are represented by operators. For example, the
                    position of a particle is represented by the position
                    operator, and the momentum of a particle is represented by
                    the momentum operator.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Schrödinger equation, a foundational equation in quantum
                    mechanics, describes how quantum operators evolve the
                    quantum state of a system over time. This equation, and
                    quantum operators, allow us to make predictions about the
                    behavior of quantum systems, and allow us to calculate the
                    expected value of observables.
                  </p>

                  <p>Quantum Registers</p>

                  <p>
                    A quantum register plays a role similar to classical
                    computer memory, storing and manipulating (quantum)
                    information. But quantum registers can leverage the
                    principles of superposition and entanglement to perform
                    complex calculations more efficiently than classical
                    registers. A quantum register can represent multiple
                    combinations of classical bit patterns simultaneously, and
                    if the qubits inside are entangled, measuring one instantly
                    determines the state of the others.

                  <p>
                    It should be noted that quantum registers are susceptible to
                    quantum noise and errors. Maintaining the coherence of
                    qubits in a register is a significant challenge in quantum
                    computing.

                    Predictably, Quantum Information Theory is a branch of study
                    at the intersection of quantum mechanics and information
                    theory. We have already learned about Qubits, Superposition,
                    and Entanglement, which are part of Quantum Information
                    Theory. But this area also contains the study and
                    development of quantum algorithms, quantum communication,
                    and quantum cryptography.

                    Notable examples of quantum algorithms examples include
                    Grover's search algorithm and Shor's factoring algorithm.

                    Quantum computing has its own programming languages,
                    including Qiskit, Cirq, and Quipper. Quantum Hardware
                    platforms, such as quantum processors, are offered by
                    companies like IBM and Google. Go buy one and call me.

                  <p>Quantum Field Theory</p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a fundamental framework in
                    theoretical physics that describes the behavior of quantum
                    fields, which are fields of particles like photons or
                    electrons. While quantum computing is not focused on the
                    theoretical development of QFT, it uses the principles and
                    techniques derived from QFT to create algorithms and
                    simulations that have the potential to solve complex
                    problems more efficiently than classical computers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For example, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a specific
                    quantum field theory that describes the electromagnetic
                    force and the behavior of photons and electrons. Quantum
                    algorithms for simulating physical systems often rely on QED
                    as a basis for understanding quantum interactions.
                  </p>

                  <p>Quantum Mechanics & Semiconductors</p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum mechanics also describes the behavior of electrons
                    within the crystal lattice of semiconductor materials, which
                    is super relevant to my field of computer science and thus
                    makes me feel slightly more responsible about writing this
                    ridiculous treatise.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now, we have already learned about Quantized Energy Levels
                    or quantum states, and that is good because this concept is
                    important for understanding how quantum mechanics influences
                    the behavior of our semiconductors. Electrons in a
                    semiconductor occupy specific energy levels, also known as
                    electron bands. And there are two key energy bands: the
                    valence band and the conduction band.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The valence band is the band containing electrons at their
                    lowest energy levels.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now this may be confusing because valence electrons
                    typically occupy the highest energy level or outermost
                    electron shell in their respective atoms. However, in the
                    context of semiconductor materials, the term "valence band"
                    refers to a specific energy band within the crystal lattice
                    of the material, and it contains electrons at their lowest
                    energy levels relative to the conduction band.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    There’s really only two bands here, valence and conduction.
                    Valence means the electrons are still atom-associated.
                    Conduction means they are “free electrons” which can move
                    about according to electric fields. We will learn all about
                    these two bands, how electrons jump the gap between them,
                    and what electric fields are, later.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But for now, let’s look at an example just to get clear on
                    this definition. In a silicon wafer, multiple atoms come
                    together to form a crystal lattice. The valence band in the
                    semiconductor's energy band structure represents a
                    collection of energy levels that result from the
                    interactions between these atoms within the crystal lattice.
                    In this context, valence band doesn't refer to the outermost
                    electron shells of individual atoms but rather to the energy
                    levels within the crystal lattice where electrons are most
                    likely to be found. These energy levels are associated with
                    the collective behavior of electrons in the semiconductor
                    material, which is a very quantum sentence, I am learning.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Electrons in the valence band are tightly bound to atoms and
                    do not contribute to electrical conductivity (unlike typical
                    valence electrons). The conduction band however is the
                    energy level above the valence band. Electrons in the
                    conduction band are free to move, and their movement
                    contributes to electrical conductivity.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Again, we will get deeper into this later on at some point,
                    but make a mental note here of there are these two bands,
                    one wherein electrons move freely and the other where they
                    are tightly bound. This is characteristic of SEMIconductors.
                    If they were full-on conductors, the electrons would flow,
                    and there would be less of a distinction between the two
                    bands (a smaller band gap). If they were insulators, they
                    wouldn’t flow.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    And more than this, it is not even as simple as “they
                    conduct half as much as conductors, X times as much as
                    insulators.” Importantly, semiconductor conductivity is not
                    fixed; it can be controlled. This is unusual and
                    significant. Matter’s relative degree of conductivity is not
                    typically a malleable property. Let us explore how this
                    might be the case for semiconductors.
                  </p>

                  <p>Band Gap and Quantum Tunneling</p>

                  <p>
                    The energy gap between the valence band and the conduction
                    band is called the band gap. It's a critical concept in
                    semiconductor behavior. Electrons in the valence band cannot
                    move into the conduction band unless they gain sufficient
                    energy to overcome the band gap. This energy can be supplied
                    through external factors like heat or an applied electric
                    field. However, with semiconductors, especially the smallest
                    of transistors, the band gap can be overcome without the
                    requisite energy, and this fact is crucial for modern
                    computing. But how is this so?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum mechanics introduces the phenomenon of quantum
                    tunneling, where particles can pass through energy barriers
                    that classical physics would consider insurmountable. In the
                    context of semiconductors, quantum tunneling allows
                    electrons to move across the band gap, even when they don't
                    have enough thermal energy. Seems impossible, right?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Well, in quantum mechanics, electrons are described not as
                    particles with definite positions and energies but as wave
                    functions that represent the probability of finding the
                    electron in a particular state. Electrons exist as a
                    probability cloud with certain energy states. And
                    Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle shows that we cannot
                    simultaneously know the exact position and momentum (or
                    energy) of a particle. This means that electrons in quantum
                    states don't have precise energies but exist within an
                    energy range.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When an electron encounters an energy barrier, such as the
                    band gap in a semiconductor, classical physics would suggest
                    that the electron cannot cross the barrier unless it
                    possesses sufficient energy to overcome it. However, due to
                    the energy uncertainty principle, electrons have a range of
                    possible energies, even within a particular energy state. In
                    the world of quantum mechanics which governs the behaviors
                    of subatomic particles, there's a probability that the
                    electron's wave function extends into the forbidden region,
                    beyond the energy barrier.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So when the electron's wave function partially overlaps with
                    the forbidden region, there's a finite probability that the
                    electron can be found on the other side of the barrier. This
                    probability of tunneling depends on several factors,
                    including the thickness and height of the barrier. In very
                    thin semiconductor structures, the barrier is relatively
                    narrow, increasing the chances of an electron tunneling
                    through.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Furthermore, while classical physics relies on thermal
                    energy to overcome energy barriers, in quantum mechanics,
                    electrons can tunnel through even when they have
                    insufficient thermal energy because of the inherent
                    probability associated with their wave functions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So cool, this basically makes sense, right? It also sounds
                    completely impossible, but moving on!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    One thing is still tugging at me though. Even though it
                    basically makes sense, it all seems so wishy-washy.
                    Computers are exactingly precise. So how is it that a
                    technology which seems so weird and squiggly can trickle up
                    into producing a computer, which pretty much always acts
                    deterministically?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Well, this apparent contradiction is resolved via the
                    combined effects of aggregated behavior, control and design,
                    quantum effects reduction, error correction, design margins,
                    classical control. Let’s take them one at a time.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Aggregated Behavior: While individual electron behavior in
                    quantum mechanics can be probabilistic, the behavior of
                    large collections of electrons (as in semiconductor
                    materials) follows statistical patterns. When you have
                    trillions of electrons in a semiconductor, their
                    probabilistic behaviors tend to average out, leading to
                    predictable and deterministic results at the macroscopic
                    level.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Control and Design: Engineers design semiconductor devices
                    and circuits with specific structures and materials that
                    minimize or control quantum effects like tunneling. This
                    involves careful engineering to ensure that quantum
                    phenomena do not significantly impact the overall operation
                    of the device.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Quantum Effects Reduction: As transistors and semiconductor
                    components have shrunk in size to nanoscale dimensions,
                    quantum effects have become more pronounced. However, modern
                    chip design uses techniques like quantum tunneling barriers,
                    which are engineered to minimize quantum effects and
                    maintain deterministic behavior.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Error Correction: Modern computer systems also employ error
                    correction techniques to account for any rare quantum errors
                    or uncertainties that may arise. These systems can detect
                    and correct errors, ensuring the overall reliability and
                    determinism of computer operations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Design Margins: Engineers build in design margins to account
                    for potential variations and uncertainties, ensuring that
                    electronic devices operate reliably even in less-than-ideal
                    conditions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Classical Control: At the macroscopic level, computer
                    operations are predominantly classical. The quantum
                    behaviors of individual particles don't noticeably affect
                    the overall deterministic function of a computer when you
                    consider the sheer scale and control applied.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So basically we just have to remember that traditional bits
                    are measured 1 or 0 by having a high enough current. So one
                    or two electrons exhibiting an unexpected quantum tunneling
                    for example, won't throw off the whole operation, because
                    remember, the current which makes up one bit has many many
                    electrons in a field contributing to the registering as 1 or
                    0 of that particular piece of data. And that last sentence
                    makes sense to you because you understand what current is,
                    because we have remained on topic and we have been
                    discussing electricity this whole time. Fuck.
                  </p>

                  <p>Okay, just one last quantum topic!!!</p>

                  <p>Doping and Semiconductors</p>

                  <p>
                    When semiconductors are doped with specific atoms, such as
                    phosphorus or boron, the added atoms introduce additional
                    energy states within the band gap. Phosphorus doping
                    introduces extra electrons, creating new energy states
                    within the band gap known as donor states. Boron doping
                    creates electron holes, which are vacancies in the valence
                    band and are referred to as acceptor states. These added
                    states enable the controlled manipulation of semiconductor
                    conductivity.
                  </p>

                        Buuuuuut, not so fast. On our way up from the less-often
                        heard of elementary particles and the quantum, we meet
                        the atomic. And while we covered in depth the more
                        esoteric subatomic particles, we better gain a thorough
                        understanding of electrons if we want to grock
                        electricity. After all, the smallest quantity of
                        electricity that exists in the natural world is a single
                        electron.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Yeah so we’ve got atoms, which are what they sound like
                        as long as you’ve made it past 7th grade. The
                        organization of a typical atom has a nucleus of protons
                        and neutrons, which we’re now intimately more familiar
                        with than the average joe, as well as electrons orbiting
                        outside, probabilistically located somewhere within
                        different energy levels, or orbitals. Probabilistic
                        because these discrete energy levels called orbitals are
                        defined by quantum mechanics. They are most likely found
                        in certain regions, but their precise positions cannot
                        be determined exactly. And all substances are made of
                        atoms.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Since protons have a positive charge and neutrons are
                        electrically neutral, the nucleus itself is electrically
                        positive. Electrons, on the other hand, have a negative
                        charge. And because protons and electrons are equally
                        and oppositely charged, an atom is typically
                        electrically neutral.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The total number of electrons in an atom is the same as
                        that atom’s atomic number. Although there are many atoms
                        with high atomic numbers and a lot of electrons, those
                        substances are not necessarily ones through which
                        electricity easily flows—the flow of electricity depends
                        on the number of valence electrons.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let me explain why. Since the attraction from the
                        nucleus is weaker for electrons in the outermost shells
                        than ones in the innermost shells, the outermost
                        “valence” electrons may escape from orbit if external
                        energy such as heat or light is applied.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This electron leaves the atom positively charged, and
                        may remain free for some time or may jump into a
                        different atom, which could make this atom negatively
                        charged. An electron that has escaped from orbit and can
                        move around freely is called a free electron. In
                        substances like copper and other metals, through which
                        electricity easily flows, there are many free electrons,
                        and if a voltage is applied to this substance, the free
                        electrons all flow in one direction.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Electrons are far less massive (1/1836) than protons.
                        Electrons have electric potential energy due to their
                        charge, and this potential energy is smaller when they
                        are closer to the nucleus, and greater when they are
                        farther away. Because they have higher energy the
                        farther from the nucleus they are, they also have
                        greater velocity the farther out they get.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Charged particles create an electric field around
                        themselves. This field exerts forces on other charged
                        particles within its influence. The electric potential
                        energy of a charged particle (electron or proton) is
                        determined by its position within this electric field.
                        The potential energy increases as the particle moves
                        closer to similarly charged particles and farther from
                        oppositely charged particles. This energy can be
                        calculated based on the charge of the particle, the
                        distance between charges, and the strength of the
                        electric field.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Coulomb’s Force, or electrostatic force defines that
                        like repels like, and opposites attract. Coulomb's law
                        describes the force of attraction or repulsion between
                        electric charges. It states that the force is directly
                        proportional to the product of the charges and inversely
                        proportional to the square of the distance between them.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The electrons moving throughout whatever conducting
                        material were typically at one point valence electrons
                        (the same ones which form covalent bonds in other
                        contexts), but are now called free electrons. If current
                        is flowing, some electrons once in the outer shells of
                        atoms are moving through the material. Metals overall
                        will still maintain a neutral charge though (almost
                        always, and if not, then it is usually only brief
                        moments that they as a whole are charged). So there are
                        NOT more electrons within the metal than could
                        theoretically be captured within all the atoms of the
                        metal.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Metals have a "sea of electrons" in their atomic
                        structure, where some of the outermost electrons are
                        delocalized and can move freely throughout the metal
                        lattice. And these delocalized free electrons are
                        responsible for the high electrical conductivity of
                        metals. The number of free electrons is determined by
                        the number of outermost electrons in the atoms, so there
                        are relatively few when compared to the total number of
                        electrons in the metal.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        It is sometimes said that temperature increases affect
                        these outer electrons the most, causing them to “move”
                        more than others, and dislodging them from their atoms.
                        But this is a simplification. Actually, when external
                        energy, such as heat or light, is applied to a solid
                        like copper, it can affect the collective behavior of
                        electrons within the material rather than targeting
                        specific electrons in individual atoms. The valence
                        electrons are merely better situated to jump the band
                        gap as a result of the added thermal energy, which
                        allows them to then move more freely within the crystal
                        lattice.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Electrons in metals exist in energy bands, and there is
                        a distribution of energy levels among the electrons. At
                        absolute zero temperature (0 Kelvin), all electrons fill
                        the lowest available energy states within the valence
                        band (of bound electrons). In the context of the
                        electronic band structure of a solid, the valence band
                        is the lowest. The conduction band is the highest, and
                        it contains empty or partially filled energy levels.
                        Electrons in the conduction band have enough energy to
                        move freely throughout the crystal lattice and
                        contribute to electrical conductivity.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The Fermi level represents the energy level at which
                        electrons have a 50% probability of being occupied at a
                        given temperature. It represents the highest energy
                        level in the valence band that is occupied by electrons
                        at a given temperature. It is an energy level within the
                        band structure of a solid but is not a band itself.
                      </p>

                      <p>Temperature Tangent</p>

                      <p>
                        When the temperature rises above absolute zero, some
                        electrons gain thermal energy, allowing them to move
                        from the valence band to the conduction band. This
                        transition occurs because these electrons now have
                        enough energy to overcome the band gap. These electrons
                        become delocalized and are able to conduct electricity.
                        This means that the number of free electrons, and thus
                        the relative conductivity, can vary with temperature.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Specifically, metal conductivity decreases as
                        temperature rises. We’re getting a little ahead of
                        ourselves here (rather than behind, that’s a first), but
                        this behavior is described by the electrical resistivity
                        of the metal, which is the reciprocal of its
                        conductivity.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The relationship between electrical resistivity (ρ) and
                        temperature (T) in metals is often characterized by the
                        following observations:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For most metals, as the temperature increases, the
                        electrical resistivity also increases. This relationship
                        is quantified by the Temperature Coefficient of
                        Resistivity (α), which is a material-specific constant.
                        The formula for the change in resistivity with
                        temperature is given by:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Δρ = αρ₀ΔT So resistivity change equals coefficient
                        times reference resistivity (room temp) times
                        temperature change.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Most metals exhibit a positive temperature coefficient
                        of resistivity, which means that as they are heated,
                        their electrical resistivity increases, and their
                        conductivity decreases.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Some materials, when cooled to very low temperatures,
                        exhibit a drastic change in conductivity. They become
                        superconductors, which means they have zero electrical
                        resistivity at temperatures below a certain critical
                        temperature (Tc).

                      <p>Copper Case Study</p>

                      <p>
                        But let’s get back to room temperature and examine what
                        the ratio is between free and bound electrons, using
                        copper as a case study.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Copper can be considered to have either 1 valence
                        electron, or 11. This is because of the way transition
                        metal valence electrons are calculated. The more
                        traditional answer is 1, because its configuration is
                        1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s1, and the outer level
                        clearly has 1. However, another definition is “a valence
                        electron for a transition metal is defined as an
                        electron that resides outside a noble-gas core.” And the
                        condensed electron configuration, built up from its
                        noble-gas core, is [Ar]3d10 4s1. Hence 11.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Yay! You know so much about the chemistry of Copper now,
                        which is super important for understanding computers.
                        But let’s get back to it.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Copper’s atomic number is 29, and when you look at how
                        Copper reacts, it typically only forms two ions, Cu+ or
                        Cu 2+, when forming chemical bonds. So it's losing one
                        or two electrons. Knowing all of this, we might expect
                        the bound:free electrons ratio to be 27:2 or 28:1, or
                        even 18:11, because we have reasons to believe it might
                        want to lose 1, or 2, or even 11 electrons. But
                        actually, the ratio is closer to 1:1. Why?
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        While it's true that in a chemical bond, only one or two
                        valence electrons from an individual copper atom might
                        be directly involved, in the metallic state, those
                        valence electrons become part of the collective electron
                        cloud, allowing for the high mobility of electrons
                        throughout the metal lattice.

                      <p>
                        Said another way, in metals, there isn't a distinct
                        separation between the valence band and conduction band
                        like in semiconductors and insulators. Instead, there's
                        a continuous band of energy levels, and electrons are
                        free to move throughout this band. With Copper for
                        example, both valence and conduction electrons
                        contribute to electrical conductivity.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Copper can maintain a roughly 1:1 ratio because when we
                        discuss the ratio of bound to delocalized electrons in a
                        metal, we are considering the behavior of electrons in
                        the solid state rather than in individual atoms. In a
                        metal lattice, such as the one formed by copper atoms
                        when they solidify, the valence electrons from multiple
                        copper atoms interact and become delocalized throughout
                        the entire crystal structure.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This delocalization of electrons in metals is a
                        consequence of the quantum mechanical properties of
                        electron behavior in a solid. The "sea of electrons"
                        concept describes how these valence electrons are shared
                        among many atoms in the lattice, creating a pool of
                        mobile, delocalized electrons. This electron
                        delocalization is what gives metals their excellent
                        electrical conductivity. So the 1:1 ratio of bound to
                        delocalized electrons in metals like copper refers to
                        the behavior of electrons in the solid-state, where the
                        delocalization of valence electrons is a key
                        characteristic of metallic bonding.

                We are finally ready to get back to electricity! I promise to
                stay on topic this time, for real. So where were we…? Right,
                voltage. Voltage is fascinating. I can’t wait to get into
                exactly how it works, now that we understand a little bit of the
                chemistry and physics going on behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                First off, a voltage initiates a charge in a circuit. But wait,
                how is a voltage produced? Motherfucker. It seems like we need
                to understand batteries.

                    Fun fact! You can create a simple battery by placing two
                    different metals (e.g. copper and zinc) in an electrolyte
                    solution (e.g. lemon juice). This can generate a small
                    voltage. But how?
                  </p>

                  <p>Voltage</p>

                  <p>
                    Voltage. We’ve mentioned the word twice now, each time
                    getting swept quickly into some divergent topic. This time,
                    we’re going to cover it for real, right here in the
                    batteries section (doesn’t mean we can’t learn even more
                    about it later!).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So what is it? How is it initiated? What are batteries
                    actually?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So, voltage is essentially the electric potential energy per
                    unit charge. It represents the electrical potential
                    difference between two points in a circuit. In other words,
                    it's the energy (potential energy) that an electron
                    possesses when it's at a certain point in a circuit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Think of it as the "potential" for an electric charge to do
                    work due to its position in the field. It is a measure of
                    the "push" or force that drives electrons through a
                    conductor (such as a wire or a component). It is often
                    likened to the pressure in a water pipe. It provides the
                    energy needed to move electrons through a circuit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Higher voltage means more electrical "pressure," which can
                    result in greater current flow. As a final analogy, you can
                    think of voltage like the height difference in a
                    gravitational field. If you have an object at a higher
                    elevation, it has more gravitational potential energy than
                    an object at a lower elevation. Similarly, in an electrical
                    circuit, a higher voltage represents more potential energy
                    for electric charges.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For instance, a typical AA battery has a voltage of 1.5
                    volts, meaning there is a potential difference of 1.5 volts
                    between its positive and negative terminals. A standard car
                    battery typically has around 12 volts. A standard US
                    household electrical outlet provides 120 volts of
                    alternating current (VAC) power. Europe is vibin at 230-240
                    volts.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Power lines that transmit electricity over long distances
                    often operate in the hundreds of thousands of volts
                    (kilovolts or kV). Electric Substation facilities handle
                    tens or hundreds of kilovolts, for efficient long-distance
                    electricity transmission. And lastly research particle
                    accelerators used in scientific research can generate
                    extremely high voltages. For example, the Large Hadron (you
                    know what these are!) Collider (LHC) at CERN operates at
                    energies of several teraelectronvolts (TeV), which
                    translates to trillions of volts.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “Electric Potential Difference” is used interchangeably with
                    voltage, and it is the measure of how much the electric
                    potential at one point differs from the electric potential
                    at another point. This difference is crucial because it
                    drives the flow of electric charges (electrons) from a
                    higher potential energy point to a lower one. This is what
                    motivates electric charges to move and do work in electrical
                    circuits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So inside a battery, chemical reactions occur which create
                    an excess of electrons at the (negative) cathode and a
                    deficit of electrons at the (positive) anode. Even more
                    confusing than the fact that I can’t use anode to remember
                    negative is the fact that the cathode is only usually
                    negative, and the anode only usually positive. They can be
                    flipped sometimes. Great.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In any case, with excess opposing charges at opposite ends
                    of a conductor, nature seeks to balance this charge, so
                    electrons begin to move from the cathode to the anode
                    through an external circuit. Nature seeks to balance this
                    charge for all the reasons we explored in Atoms and
                    Electrons, because of the fundamental fact that opposites
                    attract, because of the way electromagnetic fields behave.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But how, you might be asking. I know I was. What kinds of
                    chemical reactions take place that cause these charged
                    poles? Well, they are called redox reactions
                    (reduction/oxidation), and they are reactions which have the
                    effect of atoms (or ions) losing or gaining electrons.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But what initiates these reactions? What in the physical
                    universe changes when we humans decide we want redox
                    reactions to occur? Well, the initiation of chemical
                    reactions in a battery, specifically the oxidation and
                    reduction reactions, occur due to the inherent properties of
                    the materials used in the battery, and they are initiated by
                    a physical connection between the materials within the
                    battery.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Initially, before the circuit is closed, these electrodes
                    are separated, and there is no direct path for electrons to
                    flow between them. Connect the terminals of a battery by
                    attaching a wire or completing a circuit, and now you have a
                    physical connection between the anode and cathode.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The anode is where oxidation occurs. It releases electrons
                    into the circuit, resulting in a positive charge. So the
                    anode is positive. The cathode is where reduction occurs. It
                    attracts electrons from the circuit, leading to a negative
                    charge. So the cathode is negative, and reduction =
                    electrons gained. I’m sorry. That’s just how it is.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For example, in a standard copper-zinc galvanic cell, at the
                    anode zinc (Zn) atoms lose electrons and become zinc ions
                    (Zn²⁺). Meanwhile, at the cathode, copper ions (Cu²⁺) gain
                    electrons and turn into solid copper (Cu) metal. That’s it.
                    This is a battery for you. And when you close the circuit
                    (by connecting the wires), electrons can now flow through
                    the wire anode —> cathode.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The electric potential difference (voltage) between the two
                    terminals is a measure of how much electric potential energy
                    per unit charge is available to do work. And the electrons
                    themselves (sort of) constitute “current,” measured in
                    amperes, which will be the subject of its own study when we
                    finally get to electricity.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Before we move on, let's look at a typical lithium ion
                    battery. In this case, lithium ions, which are charged
                    particles, engage in a reversible migration between two
                    vital battery components: the anode, traditionally composed
                    of graphite, and the cathode, typically housing materials
                    like lithium cobalt oxide or alternative lithium-based
                    compounds. This ion movement transpires as the battery
                    undergoes its charge and discharge cycles. During charging,
                    (positively charged) lithium ions relocate from the cathode
                    to the anode, while discharging prompts their return from
                    the anode to the cathode. Put another way, these lithium
                    ions (Li⁺) migrate from the cathode to the anode through the
                    Electrolyte, while electrons flow externally from the anode
                    to the cathode, creating a potential difference.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This process can continue as long as there is a continuous
                    path for the electrons to move, and as long as the
                    conditions that sustain the chemical reactions in a battery
                    or power source are met. The availability of reactants
                    (chemical substances involved in the chemical reactions)
                    will determine how long the source can supply a voltage.
                    Batteries have a finite capacity, and as the chemical
                    reactions deplete the reactants, the voltage will gradually
                    decrease until the battery is discharged.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So now you understand batteries! By the way, we’re getting
                    really close to actually talking about electricity. I mean
                    when you think electricity, you think batteries, amiright? I
                    am so proud.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    One last thing: it’s important to note that the materials
                    connecting the two ends must be a suitable conductor, which
                    reminds me, we’ll probably have to study materials science
                    (so briefly!) before we can get to electricity. The
                    materials used in a battery, a transistor, or an electric
                    wire have different chemical properties and different
                    electron affinities, which are important to understand.

                    This chart took a long time to make, and in my humble
                    opinion, there’s a lot of knowledge baked into it. Now, what
                    to make of it? Well, we’ve already given Copper some love,
                    which is good. But silicon deserves an even higher word
                    count tbh. Let’s just dive into metals and see where it
                    takes us!

                        Yes, I’m doing it for the emojis at this point. But on
                        the real, metals make up over 75% of the periodic table.
                        This high number is even more shocking when we consider
                        the 40 or so elements which are almost always produced
                        artificially by humans--most often in nuclear reactors,
                        via particle accelerators, or as a radioactive byproduct
                        of uranium ores. These elements are shunned at the
                        bottom of the periodic table, have weird names, and
                        typically have incredibly short half-lives, due to their
                        inherently unstable nature.
                      </p>

                      <p>So yeah, metals.</p>

                      <p>
                        Aluminum (AI) is pretty straight forward. To understand
                        its role in computers, we actually don't need an
                        exhaustive knowledge of the element itself, because it
                        is mainly used in supportive structural contexts for
                        modern computers. For example, the nice shiny outside of
                        my mac is aluminum, and more specifically it is an
                        anodized aluminum chassis, which is a type of aluminum
                        that has been treated to make it more durable and
                        resistant to corrosion.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This is the first type of reason the choice of Aluminum
                        is often made for computer exteriors--it is
                        aesthetically pleasing. It is also a highly recyclable
                        material, reducing waste and cutting costs for tech
                        companies.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Aluminum also has a very high strength-to-weight ratio,
                        and it is cheaply available for how protective it can
                        be. Aluminum possesses well-above average (for metals)
                        heat dissipation properties. In fact, it's often used
                        for heat sinks, which are passive cooling devices that
                        help dissipate heat generated by computer components
                        like CPUs and GPUs.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Aluminum conducts electricity moderately well but not
                        nearly as much as say, copper. For this reason, Aluminum
                        can be used in connectors and ports on computer
                        peripherals, such as USB ports, audio jacks, and other
                        connectors may have aluminum housing or components for
                        durability and signal integrity.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        So you see, pretty straightforward. But still, aluminum
                        is such a common and abundant material in almost every
                        modern computer, it really was worth touching on at
                        least.

                        Lithium, obviously, is a key element in lithium-ion
                        (Li-ion) and lithium-polymer (LiPo) batteries, which are
                        an incredibly innovative technology, offering high
                        energy density, long cycle life, and lightweight design.

                        Now steel is only minorly relevant in computers, making
                        up certain structural components that need to be extra
                        strong. But what the heck is steel? Kinda a distraction
                        to find out. But let’s do it anyway.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        So this I knew: steel is a broad category of alloys made
                        primarily from Iron (Fe) with varying amounts of carbon
                        and other elements. For example, carbon steel is
                        predictably composed of iron and carbon, with carbon
                        being the most significant alloying element, typically
                        ranging anywhere from 0.05% to 2%. What is commonly
                        referred to as mild steel contains a low percentage of
                        carbon, typically around 0.05% to 0.25%. It is easy
                        (welding is hard) to weld and form but not as strong as
                        higher carbon steels.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        All the rest I did not know: Medium carbon steel
                        contains between 0.3% and 0.6% carbon. It's often used
                        for structural applications. High carbon steel contains
                        carbon levels ranging from 0.6% to 2%. It's
                        exceptionally hard and used for cutting tools and
                        blades.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Stainless steel contains Iron, Chromium, and Nickel as
                        its primary elements. The exact composition can vary,
                        but typical stainless steel has about 10-12% chromium
                        and 8-10% nickel. Chromium provides corrosion resistance
                        and forms a protective oxide layer on the surface.
                        Nickel improves resistance to corrosion and enhances the
                        material's stability at both high and low temperatures.

                      <p>
                        Electrical steel is used in transformers and electrical
                        motors. It contains silicon (around 3.2-4.8%) to reduce
                        core loss and increase electrical resistivity.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        There’s a fuckton of types of steels, including alloy
                        steel, galvanized steel, tool steel, weathering steel,
                        high-strength low-alloy steel, structural steel,
                        abrasion-resistant steel, wear-resistant steel,
                        oil-hardening steel, water-hardening steel, nitriding
                        steel, high-speed steel, spring steel, etc.

                      <p>
                        Okay one last side-bar before getting back to Silicon
                        and some more relevant topics: What is the strongest
                        substance we know of, or have made, and what is it made
                        of?
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Apparently, one of the strongest substances known to
                        humanity is graphene. Graphene is an allotrope of
                        carbon, consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms
                        arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Each carbon atom in
                        graphene forms strong covalent bonds with three
                        neighboring carbon atoms. This arrangement creates a
                        very stable and strong structure. Graphene is just one
                        atom thick, making it effectively two-dimensional. This
                        structure contributes to its exceptional
                        strength-to-weight ratio.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Graphene has an incredibly high tensile strength,
                        estimated to be over 130 GigaPascals (GPa). It is also
                        incredibly stiff, with a Young's modulus (a measure of
                        stiffness) of around 1 TeraPascal (TPa), making it
                        stiffer than steel. In addition to its strength,
                        graphene is an excellent conductor of electricity and
                        heat.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        What do we use it for? Apparently, graphene's
                        exceptional electrical conductivity and electron
                        mobility make it a potential replacement for silicon in
                        electronic components. It could be used in transistors,
                        interconnects, and other electronic elements,
                        potentially leading to faster and more energy-efficient
                        devices.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        But we’re not done. Graphene's transparency and
                        conductivity make it suitable for touchscreens, flexible
                        displays, and other electronic screens, improving
                        conductivity without compromising visibility.
                        Graphene-based sensors can detect various gases,
                        chemicals, and biomolecules with high sensitivity,
                        making them valuable for environmental monitoring,
                        medical diagnostics, and even detecting computer
                        hardware issues.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Graphene's excellent thermal conductivity can be
                        utilized for heat dissipation in high-performance
                        computer components, such as CPUs and GPUs, to prevent
                        overheating. Graphene-based supercapacitors and
                        batteries may provide improved energy storage solutions
                        for portable electronics and even electric vehicles,
                        indirectly benefiting the computing industry by powering
                        devices.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In medical computing and wearable technology,
                        graphene-based materials are used for biocompatible and
                        flexible electronics, contributing to advancements in
                        healthcare technology. And lastly, researchers are
                        exploring the use of graphene in quantum computing,
                        leveraging its unique electronic properties to develop
                        qubits, which are the fundamental units of quantum
                        information.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        It’s still kind of an R&D material. But still, cool to
                        know about.
                      </p>

                      <p>Now let’s learn a bit more about Silicon.</p>

                      <p>
                        For the most part, the key to semiconductor usefulness
                        lies in the behavior of transistors. They can amplify
                        signals, act as switches, and perform logical
                        operations. Semiconductors are used to create these
                        transistors because their conductivity can be modified
                        with minute changes in voltage or current.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        This controllability allows transistors to switch
                        between conducting and non-conducting states, which
                        forms the basis of digital logic and information
                        processing. Transistors can make up a simple AND gate,
                        for example, with perhaps 4 to 6 transistors, along with
                        resistors used to bias the transistors and set their
                        operating points. Most transistors are found in the CPU
                        (and GPU), then NAND Flash Memory Cells (SSDs), Memory
                        Cells (RAM), Chipset & Motherboard, I/O, NICs, etc.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Semiconductors are energy-efficient. When a
                        semiconductor device is in the off state, it consumes
                        very little power, vital for prolonging battery life.
                        Semiconductors can be doped with various impurities to
                        change their conductivity. This versatility allows them
                        to be used in a wide range of applications, from simple
                        diodes and transistors to complex integrated circuits.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Intrinsic semiconductors are pure materials, like
                        silicon, with no intentional impurities. Extrinsic
                        semiconductors have controlled impurities added, a
                        process known as "doping." Doping involves introducing
                        specific atoms (e.g., phosphorus or boron) into the
                        semiconductor crystal structure in order to alter a
                        semiconductor's conductivity. Phosphorus doping creates
                        "n-type" semiconductors, where extra electrons are
                        available for conductivity. Boron doping creates
                        "p-type" semiconductors, where there are electron
                        "holes" that can also carry charge.

                      <p>
                        Every person alive should watch a few videos exploring
                        the depth of detail that go into modern CPUs. The sheer
                        numbers of transistors integrated into microchips, the
                        size of microchips, the speed and accuracy with which
                        these tiny devices operate, the number of chips per
                        silicon wafer, the number of wafers we could make with
                        all the silicon we have… It is worth looking into. And
                        then remind yourself of what we learned about quantum
                        computing, and the ways in which these devices can
                        perform EXPONENTIALLY better than what we have described
                        above, which is for sure, 100%, already like 5 degrees
                        more complex, detailed, and small than we can really
                        grasp as humans.

                        electricity! I am already starting to think of some
                        other topics that need diving into…

                            structures play a fundamental role in understanding
                            the electrical properties of materials used in both
                            software engineering and electronics,” so who can
                            blame me?

                          <p>
                            Crystals are materials whose atoms or molecules are
                            arranged in a highly ordered and repeating pattern.
                            This regular arrangement is crucial in determining
                            their electrical properties.

                            In solid-state physics, the electronic band
                            structure of a crystal is a key concept. It
                            describes how electrons are distributed in energy
                            levels, or bands, within the crystal. This is what
                            we talked about with regards to the band gap and
                            tunneling in semiconductors. In conductors, by
                            contrast, there is significant overlap between
                            energy bands, allowing electrons to move freely.
                            This results in high electrical conductivity.

                            The arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice
                            affects its electrical properties. For instance, in
                            a semiconductor like silicon, the diamond cubic
                            lattice structure provides a controlled environment
                            for electron movement. The lattice structure can
                            also impact electron mobility. In some materials,
                            defects or impurities in the lattice can disrupt
                            electron flow and affect conductivity.

                            Certain crystal structures exhibit piezoelectric
                            properties, meaning they generate an electric charge
                            when subjected to mechanical stress and vice versa.
                            This property is crucial in sensors and actuators.

                            Crystals with specific structures can be
                            ferroelectric or ferromagnetic, which means they
                            have spontaneous electric or magnetic polarization.
                            These properties are essential in memory devices and

                            In the semiconductor industry, the controlled growth
                            of single crystals, such as silicon, is vital for
                            producing high-quality wafers. The crystal's
                            structure impacts the efficiency and performance of
                            semiconductor devices.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Crystal structures really belong within the
                            following category of thermodynamics. Here's why:
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Crystal structures are intimately connected to phase
                            transitions in materials. Different crystal
                            structures can exist at different temperatures and
                            pressures. For example, water can exist in various
                            crystal structures (ice Ih, ice II, etc.) depending
                            on temperature and pressure conditions. These
                            transitions are governed by thermodynamic
                            principles.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of entropy
                            and order. Crystal structures represent a highly
                            ordered arrangement of atoms or molecules, which is
                            a low-entropy state.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The stability of crystal structures is determined by
                            the Gibbs free energy, a key thermodynamic
                            potential. Different crystal structures may have
                            different Gibbs free energy values at specific
                            conditions, affecting their stability.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The response of crystal structures to changes in
                            temperature is crucial. Different materials expand
                            or contract differently with temperature changes,
                            and this behavior is described by thermal expansion
                            coefficients, a thermodynamic property.

                                take a quick tour of heat and energy, and their
                                relevance to the digital domain.

                                Materials conduct heat differently. Metals, for
                                example, are good conductors, while insulators
                                like plastics are poor conductors. When crafting
                                computer hardware, like processors and memory
                                chips, knowing how materials conduct heat
                                differently can be helpful. Efficient heat
                                transfer means a cooler, more reliable device.
                                And all of the above on conducting heat is also

              <p>Voltage</p>

              <p>
                Voltage (Electric Potential): Voltage (measured in volts) is the
                electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit.
                It represents the energy per unit charge that drives current
                flow. We saw this, and more, in the batteries section.
              </p>

              <p>
                Electricity flows from a high potential to a low potential. The
                potential difference between two points is called voltage. For
                example, for our 1.5V AA battery, if we let the negative pole be
                the reference point, then the potential of the negative pole is
                0V and the potential of the positive pole is 1.5V. The potential
                difference between the positive and negative poles is the supply
                voltage of this battery.
              </p>

              <p>
                If we stack two batteries, from the middle the two potentials
                are 1.5V and -1.5V, and with the negative pole as the reference
                point, the potential is 3V. The larger the difference in
                electrical potential, the larger the voltage.
              </p>

              <p>
                Everything in an electrical circuit revolves around electric
                charges, typically electrons, as a form of stored energy
                associated with their position. In a circuit, you have a voltage
                source like a battery. This source creates a potential
                difference. It essentially "pushes" or "pulls" electrons to move
                them from one point to another. The voltage source provides
                energy to these charges. This energy is now stored in the
                charges as potential energy. The higher the voltage, the more
                potential energy the charges acquire. This potential energy sets
                up an electric field between the points of different voltages.
              </p>

              <p>
                The electric field is like a force field that exerts a force on
                the charged particles. The electric field exerts a force on the
                charges, causing them to move. Electrons, being negatively
                charged, move towards the more positive (higher voltage) side.
                This movement of charges is what we call "electric current."
              </p>

              <p>
                As the charges move, they do work. Work is essentially the
                transfer of energy. In this case, it's the potential energy
                being converted into kinetic energy (movement) as the charges
                move through the circuit. If you have devices like resistors,
                light bulbs, or transistors in the circuit, they interact with
                these moving charges. For instance, a resistor resists the flow
                of charges, causing them to lose energy in the form of heat.
              </p>

              <p>Static Electricity</p>

              <p>
                When two different substances are rubbed together, atoms
                collide, and electrons that are easily separated from the atoms
                of one substance may escape and move to the atoms of the other
                substance. At this time, the substance that lost electrons
                becomes positively charged, and the substance that gained
                electrons becomes negatively charged. A substance that carries
                electricity in this way is said to be charged, and since this
                electricity is stationary (that is, it’s not flowing), it is
                called static electricity.
              </p>

              <p>
                The quantity of the positive charge that is generated by this
                process is always the same as the quantity of the negative
                charge. Since static electricity is generated by friction, it is
                also called frictional electricity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Static electricity occurs when a material has a positive or
                negative charge, and yet no current is flowing. It remains
                charged. The way the universe works is such that this material
                will “try” to become neutral again by gaining or losing
                electrons.
              </p>

              <p>
                A polyester beanie might gather a negative charge and your hair
                a positive one. The positive charge on your hair and the
                negative charge in the beanie attract each other, and your
                positively charged hairs also try to avoid contact with each
                other by sticking out in different directions.
              </p>

              <p>
                And THEN, bringing the charged beanie to another person’s head
                causes charge to be redistributed in their body. The negative
                charge in the beanie pushes electrons away in their hair, giving
                it a positive charge. This is easier to do in the winter, when
                the air is drier (humidity makes electricity in the air
                difficult). It also depends on the material…

                Cotton will carry the positive charge if rubbed against vinyl,
                and a negative charge if rubbed against hair.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that the overall charge in their body is still neutral, as
                there has been no exchange of charge between them and the
                beanie. If something that is charged approaches something
                uncharged, electrostatic induction makes this new object charged
                too.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if there is for example an insulator between a positive
                and negative charge, the electrons cannot move. If there is a
                conductor between the two, like copper wire, the electrons will
                move.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is called electrical discharge, which has several types.
                For example, spark discharge is a brief, visible electric spark
                that occurs when there is a potential difference (voltage)
                between two conductive objects, and the electric field becomes
                strong enough to ionize the air or the medium between them,
                allowing the electrons to jump across the gap.
              </p>

              <p>
                Electrical Arcing is a sustained electrical discharge that
                occurs between two conductive surfaces when they come into
                contact or are very close together. In Electronic Components
                like capacitors or discharge lamps, electrical discharge can
                occur when stored electrical energy is rapidly released.
              </p>

              <p>
                And lightning is also a form of electrical discharge! Tiny water
                droplets in clouds rub against each other, and the static
                electricity that is produced discharges to the ground. Since air
                is an insulator, a discharge does not occur easily. Hail and ice
                particles in cumulonimbus clouds collide with each other, and
                electric charge accumulates. An electrical discharge eventually
                occurs, either within the cloud itself or in the form of
                lightning to the ground.
              </p>

              <p>
                When a large amount of charge builds up, and there is a
                difference in potential between the positive and negative charge
                or, in other words, when the voltage becomes very high... The
                insulation of the air suddenly breaks down, and an electrical
                discharge occurs.
              </p>

              <p>
                So to review, a force called electrostatic force (also known as
                Coulomb’s force) operates between two charges. This force causes
                the same types of charge to repel each other and different types
                of charge to attract each other.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let’s dig a little deeper. The size of the electrostatic force F
                of attraction or repulsion (measured in a unit called a newton)
                operating between charge Q1 and Q2 is directly proportional to
                the product of Q1 and Q2 and inversely proportional to the
                square of the distance (r meters) between the charges.
              </p>

              <p>
                It sounds kinda crazy but it’s actually pretty straightforward.
                The stronger the charges, and the smaller the distance, the
                larger the resulting electrostatic force. This is called
                Coulomb’s law with respect to static electricity. I found a good
                visual demonstration below, so I’ll run through another very
                similar example.
              </p>

              <p>
                If static electricity is generated by rubbing a vinyl sheet on a
                person’s hair, the hair has a positive charge, the vinyl has a
                negative charge, and the hair clings to the vinyl due to the
                electrostatic force.
              </p>

              <p>
                Also, if the negatively charged vinyl sheet is brought close to
                hair that has not been charged, the hair will become positively
                charged and will cling to the vinyl. This phenomenon, in which
                something that is not charged becomes charged when it is in
                close proximity to something else that is charged, is called
                electrostatic induction.

                Static electricity is more easily generated as the air gets
                drier—humidity prevents static electricity from gathering on a
                surface. Also, some clothes easily become charged, while others
                do not, depending on the material they are made from. Since silk
                has good water absorbency and contains much more moisture than
                synthetic fibers, it can reduce the occurrence of static
                electricity.
              </p>

              <p>
                The polarities of the charges that are generated by friction
                differ according to the materials that are rubbed together.
                These differences are represented by the triboelectric series.
                The farther apart the materials are in the triboelectric series,
                the more static electricity is generated between them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Electrical discharge, in general, is the phenomenon in which
                charge flows continuously. This continuous flow of electricity
                is called current.
              </p>

              <p>Current</p>

              <p>
                Just like water flows naturally from a higher to a lower level,
                electrons (and electricity) flow from a higher potential
                difference (outer orbitals) to a lower one (closer to the
                nucleus). If at one end of a copper wire, you introduce a
                surplus of electrons (via chemical reactions), and at the other
                end a deficit, and then you unblock the pathway between them,
                electrons (or the electric field rather) will flow.
              </p>

              <p>
                This flow can be measured in amps, the number of electrons
                passing through a certain point along the wire. And finally,
                just as water flowing downhill might do work by turning a water
                wheel or hydroelectric generator, electricity also performs
                various kinds of work when current flows. A watt is the unit
                representing electrical power, the amount of work done per
                second while electricity flows.
              </p>
              <p>
                Power (w) = volts x amps. For example, a house utility bill
                might measure electricity consumed KWH (kilowatt hour). But
                before we analyze watts, let’s continue with our deeper dive on
                current.
              </p>

              <p>
                Current is the quantity of electricity flowing per second
                through a conductor, and it is represented using the symbol I,
                which comes from the initial letter of “Intensity of
                Electricity”. Current is measured in amperes (A), or amps for
                short. One amp is equal to one coulomb per second.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is sometimes called the “rate” at which electrons move
                through a circuit, but don’t confuse that with speed. It can be
                seen as the amount of electrons passing through a specific point
                in the circuit per unit of time, and in this sense, it
                quantifies the quantity of charge carriers (electrons) passing
                through that point. But this is not the same as speed.
              </p>

              <p>
                So anyways, as electrons flow through the circuit, they do work.
                In a circuit, components like resistors, capacitors, and light
                bulbs provide resistance to the flow of electrons. This
                resistance causes the electrons to lose some of their energy as
                they move through the circuit, which results in various
                electrical effects like lighting a bulb or powering a device.
              </p>

              <p>
                Confusingly, conventional current is defined as moving in the
                opposite direction of electrons. This is because before we even
                knew about electrons, when we believed that the movement of
                protons was mostly responsible for electricity, we defined it
                this way.
              </p>

              <p>
                History! In 600 BC, a Greek Philosopher fucking around with
                Amber and cloth got curious and started naming shit he saw.
                Electron means Amber in Greek, and what was then a mysterious
                force now had a name. Hence, why almost 300 years before the
                discovery of electrons in 1897, we still called it electricity.
              </p>

              <p>
                In reality current is occurring throughout the entire channel,
                and it is somewhat arbitrary which way we define it. And so
                conventional current is still defined as moving in the opposite
                direction of electrons and the electric field for historical
                continuity, simplifying mathematical equations, and clarity/ease
                in circuit diagrams. In reality current is occurring throughout
                the entire channel, and it is somewhat arbitrary for practical
                purposes which direction we define it as moving in.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember, 1 coulomb of charge is approximately 6.242 x 10^18
                electrons! When we say there's a current of 1 ampere, it means
                that 1 coulomb of charge, or 6.242 x 10^18 electrons, is passing
                through some point in the circuit each second.
              </p>

              <p>Electron Speed</p>

              <p>
                And remember, this is not a measurement of the speed at which
                these electrons are moving. However, if we ask ourselves how
                fast these electrons are moving, we get some interesting answers
                with important implications.
              </p>

              <p>
                Let’s get into it. First off, it's important to know from the
                outset that the speed at which electrons move through a circuit
                can be a bit counterintuitive.
              </p>

              <p>
                That’s because electrons in a typical electrical circuit move
                quite slowly on an individual level. Their speed is on the order
                of millimeters per second, and an individual electron’s
                direction is quite random. This is because they frequently
                collide with other atoms and electrons in the material, causing
                a sort of "drift" rather than a continuous flow.
              </p>

              <p>
                Electrons in a conductor don't all move at the same speed, and
                because of all these collisions, they have a highly random
                motion. Some might be moving faster than others due to their
                thermal energy. But, on average, they move at the drift velocity
                determined by the applied voltage.
              </p>

              <p>
                The reason our electronics are so fast is that when a voltage is
                applied to the circuit, it creates an electric field that pushes
                electrons. This field doesn't rely solely on the movement of
                individual electrons but rather on the electromagnetic
                properties of the conductor. Under this influence, electrons
                accelerate, achieving a certain "drift velocity" in a particular
                direction, which again is quite counterintuitively small.
              </p>

              <p>
                Despite the hectic landscape of collisions, the electric field
                created by the voltage change still propagates rapidly through
                the conductor because it affects all electrons simultaneously.
                When the field changes, it affects all electrons immediately,
                causing them to collectively adjust their motion, resulting in
                signal propagation.
              </p>

              <p>
                So the "speed" we associate with the performance of computers is
                the speed at which electrical signals, which are changes in
                voltage, propagate through electronic components like
                transistors and wires. This speed is near the speed of light in
                the material (close to 3 x 10^8 meters per second in copper).
              </p>

              <p>
                If you’re anything like me you might now be asking why is it
                that a mere change in voltage can transmit data? Voltage isn’t
                current, it’s only the pressure or potential energy difference.
                So how can the high speed of our computers be associated with
                the voltage rather than the drift speed?
              </p>

              <p>
                Another way to put this question is: what physically transmits
                the data? What is a field, or a “signal” in purely physical
                terms?
              </p>

              <p>
                So voltage itself doesn't transmit data directly. Voltage
                represents the potential energy difference or electrical
                pressure in a circuit. It's the interaction between voltage and
                the electrical properties of components that allows data to be
                transmitted. A higher voltage means a stronger electric field,
                which imparts more force to the electrons. This results in a
                higher drift velocity and, therefore, a higher current.
              </p>

              <p>
                Specifically, when the voltage changes at one end of a
                conductor, it sets up an electric field along the conductor's
                length. This electric field exerts a force on the electrons
                within the conductor. Electrons in the conductor are negatively
                charged, so they experience a force in the direction of the
                electric field. This force causes the electrons to move, and
                they start to drift in response to the voltage change.
              </p>

              <p>
                As one electron moves in response to the force, it creates an
                electric field around itself, which affects neighboring
                electrons. This interaction causes a chain reaction where
                electrons are pushed one after another. This results in the
                signal propagating down the conductor. The signal travels at
                nearly the speed of light through the conductor, depending on
                the properties of the material.
              </p>

              <p>
                And remember, the individual electrons aren’t moving this
                fast—they’re more or less jostling about randomly. But the
                overall effect of the electric field causes a coordinated
                movement of charge, allowing the voltage signal to propagate
                quickly and efficiently through the conductor.
              </p>

              <p>
                I like to imagine a ripple effect. The voltage changes at one
                end, and all electrons respond, with the general trend being
                directed at the other end at very high speeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Buuuut, if we’re going to use the ripple analogy, its important
                to also keep in mind that the concept of signal propagation
                involves the interaction of electromagnetic fields within the
                conductor and doesn't solely rely on a chain reaction of
                individual electrons moving from one end to the other.
                Electromagnetic theory and wave propagation principles are
                fundamental in understanding how signals are transmitted through
                conductors, but we won’t go into these details here.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, keeping to our more simplistic “ripple effect” model, what
                exactly happens at that other end to complete the transmission
                of whatever price of data is being sent? What, physically, is a
                field or a signal (or a ripple)?
              </p>

              <p>
                Well, individual electrons (or waves) which happen to be closest
                to the receiving end, or course. The behavior of electrons near
                the receiving end is crucial because their movement initiates
                the signal detection and processing. As the electrical field
                arrives, it exerts a force on the electrons throughout the
                conductor. The electrons at the receiving end transmit the
                signal into the receiving circuit.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, we’ve made it. The change in voltage is detected by the
                receiving end as a change in potential energy, which corresponds
                to the binary data being transmitted.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the receiving end of the conductor there are components
                designed to detect and interpret changes in voltage. Often, the
                received signal is conditioned to remove noise or distortions
                that might have occurred during transmission. This can involve
                amplifying weak signals, filtering out unwanted frequencies, and
                ensuring that the signal is in the correct format for further
                processing. 5V might get logged as a “1” while .5V as a “0.”
              </p>

              <p>
                In older technologies like TTL, a voltage below approximately
                0.8V is typically considered a logical zero (0), and a voltage
                above approximately 2.0V is considered a logical one (1). These
                values can vary slightly between different TTL families. Modern
                digital electronics, including microprocessors and most
                integrated circuits, often use CMOS technology. In CMOS, the
                threshold voltage for distinguishing between 0 and 1 is
                typically around 50% of the supply voltage. For example, if the
                supply voltage (Vcc) is 3.3 volts, a voltage below 1.65 volts is
                considered 0, and a voltage above 1.65 volts is considered 1.
              </p>

              <p>
                So now we know! What is moving in a circuit? How fast? Now we
                know. Of course, other factors, such as the miniaturization of
                silicon semiconducting transistors, parallel processing,
                gigahertz clock speeds, etc contribute to the speed of
                computers. But on the level of electricity, this is what speed
                is made of.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now that we get Voltage and Current, what else is there to know?
                Don’t forget that we also learned about Coulomb's law up above
                in the Atoms and Electrons sections.
              </p>

              <p>
                Well damn. We should briefly just pause here and realize that
                we’ve really mastered the basics at this point. No one can say
                we don’t know what electricity is. So great job :) That being
                said, there are definitely more concepts to cover. Stay tuned.
              </p>

              <h5>Ohm's Law, Resistance, Power, Charge, and Work Done</h5>
              <p>
                Ohm’s Law states that V = IR. This describes the relationship
                between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an
                electrical circuit. It is fundamental!
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, if something has high voltage yet low amperage in
                an electrical circuit, it implies high resistance. This suggests
                that the material in the circuit has high resistance, meaning it
                resists the flow of electrical current. Materials with high
                resistance typically do not conduct electricity well and may be
                insulators or semiconductors rather than good conductors like
                metals.
              </p>

              <p>
                Or, high resistance could also be intentionally engineered into
                materials with higher conductivity, as is the case in ESD
                protection devices, High-Voltage Transmission Lines, and
                High-Voltage Capacitors.
              </p>

              <p>
                Resistance (measured in ohms), is a property of a material that
                opposes the flow of electric current. It is related to factors
                like the material's composition, length, and cross-sectional
                area. Resistance is often used to generate the desired effect in
                our engineered electronics.
              </p>

              <p>
                Power (measured in watts) represents the rate at which
                electrical energy is “used” or produced in a circuit.
                Specifically, it is the electric energy consumed in one second
                when current flows. One watt is equal to one joule per second.
              </p>

              <p>
                It can be calculated as the product of voltage and current, P =
                VI. Watts = Volts x Amps. This is known as the Power Equation.
                It is also stated as Watt's Law (for DC circuits): P = IV, where
                P is power, I is current, and V is voltage. This is a
                straightforward way to calculate power in direct current (DC)
                circuits.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use this equation to determine the power a particular
                device draws. The power of a 120V device in which 12A of current
                flows is 120V × 12A = 1440W.
              </p>

              <p>
                A typical American household contains many 120V devices. If you
                divide the power value that is displayed on each of these
                devices by 120V, you can find the value of the current that
                flows in each device.
              </p>

              <p>
                For devices with the same power, a 240V electronic device runs
                using half the current of an 120V electronic device.
              </p>
              <p>I = 1440W / 240V = 6A of current flowing</p>

              <p>
                Another way to represent Voltage, besides that which we learned
                via Ohm's Law, is V = W/Q. Power can be written as W = Q * V.
              </p>

              <p>
                And this new variable of Q is the amount of charge moved. Work
                Done (W) represents the amount of energy transferred when
                electric charges move from one point to another within a
                circuit. It's measured in joules (J), which is the standard unit
                of energy. The work done (W) is directly proportional to the
                amount of charge (Q) being moved and the voltage (V) across
                which the charge is moved.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, there are several potential confusions here which should be
                cleared up.
              </p>

              <p>
                First off, "watts" and "work done" are related concepts in the
                field of physics, but they are not the same thing.
              </p>

              <p>
                Watts (W) are a unit of power, and power is the rate at which
                work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or
                converted. One watt is equal to one joule of work done per
                second. It's a measure of how quickly work or energy is being
                used or produced. Remember that Power is denoted by P, and it is
                only its unit of measurement (watts) which is denoted with W.
                But work done is straight up denoted with W.
              </p>

              <p>
                Work Done (W) is a measure of energy transfer. It is symbolized
                by the letter "W.” Work is done when a force is applied to an
                object, causing it to move a certain distance in the direction
                of the force. The work done (in joules) is calculated by
                multiplying the force applied (in newtons) by the distance over
                which the force is applied (in meters).
              </p>

              <p>
                You can find the amount of energy, which is the total amount of
                work done by an electrical device, by multiplying the power it
                draws and the time the device operates. Power is often measured
                by power companies in kWh (kilowatt hours). For example, if an
                electric heater with 1kW is used for 1 hour, the amount of
                energy it uses is 1kW × 1 hour = 1kWh. A watt-second is
                equivalent to a joule (J). For example, when a 1kW electric
                heater is used for 1 hour, since 1 hour = 60 minutes × 60
                seconds = 3600 seconds, the amount of energy used is 1kW × 3600
                seconds = 3600kWs or 3,600,000 joules.
              </p>

              <p>
                Secondly, charge (Q) could be confused with Current. These two
                values are actually quite close to each other, but they are
                still different.
              </p>

              <p>
                Charge (Q) refers to the quantity of electric charge being
                transferred. It's measured in coulombs (C), which is the
                standard unit of electric charge. In the context of a circuit, Q
                represents the number of electrons or other charged particles
                moving through the circuit (sounds like current, doesn’t it).
              </p>

              <p>
                However, Q represents the total electric charge that has moved
                through a circuit. It is typically measured in units of coulombs
                (C). Importantly, charge is a scalar quantity that tells you how
                much electric charge has passed through a specific point in the
                circuit.
              </p>

              <p>
                One coulomb represents a substantial amount of charge,
                approximately equivalent to the charge of 6.242 x 10^18
                electrons. Charge is a property of matter, and it can be either
                positive (as in protons) or negative (as in electrons).
              </p>

              <p>
                Current, on the other hand, is a vector quantity with both
                magnitude and direction, indicating the flow of charged
                particles (usually electrons) per unit of time. Current can be
                thought of as the amount of charge passing through a point in
                the circuit per unit of time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Current tells you how many charges (typically electrons) pass
                through a specific point in a circuit per unit of time. In
                mathematical terms, I = ΔQ/Δt. This is the formula we used above
                when we calculated the amount of electrons flowing per second at
                1A. We used 1C (charge/Q measured in coulombs!), divided it by
                time, and said that “one amp is equal to one coulomb per
                second”.
              </p>

              <p>
                So Q tells you the total charge passed, while current tells you
                how fast that charge is moving (and in which direction).
              </p>

              <p>
                Let’s do a practice problem! Voltage (V) as previously
                discussed, represents the electric potential difference between
                two points in the circuit. It's measured in volts (V), which are
                equivalent to joules per coulomb (J/C).
              </p>

              <p>
                If you have a 9-volt battery (V) and you move 3 coulombs (Q) of
                charge from one terminal to the other in the circuit, the work
                done (W) would be what?
              </p>

              <p>Word Done = Charge (Q) * Voltage</p>

              <p>So, W = 3 C * 9 V = 27 joules (J)</p>

              <p>
                So, in this case, 27 joules of energy are transferred when 3
                coulombs of charge move across a 9-volt potential difference in
                the circuit. Got it? Good, let’s move on.
              </p>

              <p>Electrical Circuits</p>
              <p>
                Not only are we super on topic now learning about all things
                electricity. We’re now learning about electrical circuits, which
                is about as computer science-adjacent as you can get. I really
                am so proud.
              </p>

              <p>
                Probably the simplest example of an electrical circuit is a
                flashlight, so let’s start there.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first thing to wrap our minds around is, that in a
                flashlight, the lightbulb is the load. The voltage of the power
                supply is called the power supply voltage, or electromotive
                force. The load also has a property that hinders the flow of
                current, called electric resistance, which we looked at earlier.
                The resistance is what converts electrical energy to light
                energy.
              </p>

              <p>
                The path through which this current flows is called an electric
                circuit, which always has a closed form (it is a closed
                circuit). For a circuit that uses a battery the current
                direction it’s always the same and its size is constant. This is
                an example of Direct Current, or a DC circuit. Being shocked by
                a DC current feels like a prick.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the other hand, the type of electricity which comes out of a
                power outlet is Alternating Current. The direction in which this
                current flows alternates 50 to 60 times per second and its size
                varies according to a regular waveform. In the US it is 60.
                Also, we mentioned earlier that the (AC) voltage that comes to
                an electric outlet in a home is generally 120V in the United
                States, but this is the effective voltage. The peak voltage is
                approximately 170V. Being shocked by an AC current is getting
                electrocuted, because the current is changing direction rapidly
                (its size and its direction). Not fun. Or maybe you’re into
                that?
              </p>

              <p>
                The amount of types the current direction switches per second is
                called the frequency, denoted with F, and it is measured in
                Hertz (Hz).
              </p>

              <p>
                There are two main connection methods used in electric circuits,
                series and parallel.
              </p>

              <p>
                Series connections are used for connecting two resistances in a
                line, think one after the other. In this case, current flows
                with the same size throughout. So current of power supply =
                current of resistance 1 = current of resistance 2, and voltage
                of power supply = voltage of resistance 1 + voltage of
                resistance 2.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, household lighting circuits, or maybe even more
                intuitively, a string of Christmas lights, use series
                connections (or at least they used to). We know this because
                when we used to put up a string of old Christmas lights, if one
                bulb burnt out, the entire string went dark. This is because
                they were connected in a series circuit.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you turn on the circuit, the current flows through one
                light bulb and then through the other, one after the other. The
                current passing through one component is the same as the current
                passing through the other components. So, if you have a 2A
                current flowing from the power supply, 2 amps of current will
                flow through the first light bulb and then continue to flow
                through the second one. Let’s go back to household lights for
                the sake of a simpler calculation (less lights).
              </p>

              <p>
                Consider a somewhat unrealistic household lighting circuit with
                two light bulbs connected in series. The current is consistent
                throughout the circuit, but as it encounters the resistance of
                each component, it experiences a voltage drop. This is why, in a
                series circuit, voltage across each component adds up to the
                total voltage supplied by the power source.
              </p>

              <p>
                If each light bulb has a voltage drop of, say, 120 volts, and
                they are connected in series, the total voltage across the
                circuit will be the sum of these voltages, which is 240 volts.
                This means that the power supply must provide a voltage equal to
                the sum of the individual voltage drops across the resistors.
              </p>

              <p>
                So the total voltage across the circuit is given as 240 volts.
                And the current is 2 amps. Ohm’s Law gives us that R = V/I, so
                the total resistance should be 240/2, or 120. This might mean
                that each light bulb has a resistance of 60 ohms, or they may be
                different. But they will add up to 120.
              </p>

              <p>Make sense? Great.</p>

              <p>
                Because of the way we add resistance in a series circuit, the
                ‘effective resistance’ can be considered as simply the total
                resistance of all resistors in the circuit.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a parallel circuit, things are a little different. First of
                all, in a parallel connection, two resistances are connected
                side-by-side. This is how most home lighting actually works, and
                really most things nowadays. A good example to take as our case
                study might be electrical outlets. If one device has a short
                circuit or stops working, it doesn't affect the others. This is
                because they are circuited in parallel.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a parallel circuit, each component has its own branch
                connected directly to the power source. This configuration
                ensures that if one component fails or has higher resistance, it
                won't affect the others, making parallel circuits highly
                reliable (and safer).
              </p>

              <p>
                In a parallel circuit, the current of power supply = current of
                resistance 1 + current of resistance 2, and voltage of power
                supply = voltage of resistance 1 = voltage of resistance 2.
                Because there is branching in a parallel circuit, the current is
                divided between the branches. The voltage however, is felt the
                same throughout. This concept is described by Kirchhoff's
                Voltage Law (KVL), which states that the total voltage in a
                closed loop or a series of connected components must equal zero.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is how, in a typical American home, 120V can be sent to
                each device within the home. We are running a parallel circuit.
                The more devices which are connected, the higher amperage we
                require. But the voltage we don’t need to touch.
              </p>

              <p>
                Components in parallel receive different currents (and all have
                the same voltage). This is because they are connected across the
                same two points in the circuit. The total resistance in a
                parallel circuit is less than the smallest individual
                resistance. This is because of the way Ohm’s Law works itself
                out when the numerator is constant and the denominator is ever
                increasing: R = V / I. Total resistance will only grow smaller
                and smaller as we add more current (for more devices) across a
                constant voltage. And multiplying even 2 amp values together
                will of course give a larger value than any single amp value
                (and hence yield a lower total resistance). Put simply, adding
                more branches with components actually reduces the overall
                resistance.
              </p>

              <p>
                A household electric appliance also acts as a resistance. We can
                connect many of them in parallel to a 120V power supply from the
                breaker. Electric wire has a very low resistance and is used to
                connect circuit elements. When a small amount of current flows
                through wire, we can consider its resistance negligible. But the
                more devices we connect, the greater the total resistance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Resistance (R), basically, is a measure indicating the
                difficulty of the flow of current. It measures how much a
                material opposes the flow of current. And if a larger amount of
                current flows through a wire than can do so safely, heat will be
                generated. The resistance (measured in ohms) of a conductor with
                length L meters and cross-sectional area A square meters can be
                represented by R = ρ × L / A.
              </p>

              <p>
                Resistivity, represented by the symbol ρ, is a material-specific
                resistance value and is measured in ohm meters (Ω m). From this
                equation it is apparent that for the same material, the size of
                the resistance is directly proportional to the length and
                inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.
              </p>

              <p>
                Conductance (G), in contrast to resistance, is a measure
                indicating the ease of the flow of current and is measured in
                siemens (S). The siemens is an inverse ohm. It is also sometimes
                called a mho and can be represented by the symbol Ω-1.
                Conductivity, represented by the symbol σ, is the reciprocal of
                resistivity, and it is measured in siemens per meter (S/m). This
                is what we detailed in the materials science chart above.

              <p>Electricity and Joule Heat</p>

              <p>
                A calorie is a measurement of heat, because heat is produced
                when food is digested. The amount of heat required to raise 1
                gram of pure water from 14.5°c to 15.5°c at 1 atmospheric
                pressure is approximately 4.2J, and this corresponds to 1
                calorie. In the same way, heat is produced when electricity
                flows through resistance. For example, you can find the amount
                of heat produced when current I flows through resistance R for t
                seconds by calculating I^2 × R × t. The symbol Q is used to
                represent heat, and we measure it in J (joules). Q = I^2 × R ×
                t.
              </p>

              <p>
                We know the power equation is P = VI, and V = IR. So we can
                rewrite the equation as P = I^2 * R. If we add in time, we get
                the equation above.
              </p>

              <p>
                But...why does electricity generate heat? The atoms that make up
                a substance are always vibrating, called thermal vibration.
                Temperature corresponds to the magnitude of thermal vibrations.
                When an object is heated, its atoms vibrate more. The
                temperature at which there is no thermal vibration is called
                absolute zero, which corresponds to -273.15°c.
              </p>

              <p>
                We recently talked about the load having a property called
                electric resistance, which hinders the flow of current.
                Actually, that property is due to the vibration of the atoms. if
                an atom is vibrating, it's harder for electrons to move around.
                When the temperature of some materials, such as aluminum, drops
                near absolute zero, the atoms reach a state of rest. At this
                point, electrons are able to move freely without colliding with
                the atoms—that is, there is no resistance at all. This is called
                superconductivity.
              </p>

              <p>
                When current flows in aluminum wire at a normal temperature,
                electrons violently collide with aluminum atoms, creating larger
                thermal vibrations and generating heat. As temperature
                increases, thermal vibration increases, electrons can no longer
                move smoothly, and resistance increases. Conductivity decreases.
                There’s too much commotion for an electric field to propagate
                efficiently.
              </p>

              <p>How about light?</p>

              <p>
                When current flows through a resistance and the temperature
                rises, heat is generated, and waves are emitted. From longest to
                shortest, the possible waves are AM, FM, VHF, UHF, Micro,
                Infrared, Visible Light, Ultraviolet, X-rays, and Gamma rays.
                This phenomenon, in which the temperature of a substance
                increases and thermal energy is emitted as electromagnetic
                waves, is called thermal emission. It is the principle of light
                emission in light bulbs. It's also why it gets warm near most
                light bulbs.
              </p>

              <p>
                Actually, light emission due to thermal emission mostly ends up
                becoming heat, so it's inefficient to use it as light. One type
                of light emission that isn't thermal emission is called
                luminescence. it is used in fluorescent lights. First, electrons
                escape from the filament. The electrons collide with mercury
                atoms, which emit ultraviolet rays. These UV rays strike the
                fluorescent material painted on the inside of the tube, which
                emits visible light. For the same electric power consumption, a
                fluorescent light emits more than four times the light of a
                regular light bulb.

              <p>Current and Magnetic Fields</p>

              <p>
                Electromagnetism is the phenomenon where electric current
                generates a magnetic field and vice versa. It plays a crucial
                role in motors, generators, and transformers. Electric fields
                and magnetic fields are regions of influence surrounding charged
                particles or magnets, respectively. They exert forces on other
                charged particles or magnets within their influence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Electricity and magnetism are inseparably bound together. The
                Earth itself is like an enormous magnet. Its magnetism is called
                geomagnetism, and it is the reason a compass works.
              </p>

              <p>
                Magnetic fields are generated when current flows in electric
                wire. Magnetic fields are generated in a circular pattern around
                the wire. This is called Ampère's law. you can remember how it
                works using your right hand. If I point my right thumb in the
                direction of the current, my fingers curl in the direction the
                magnetic field is generated. The strength of the magnetic field
                varies according to the strength of the current. if the
                direction of the current changes, the direction of the magnetic
                field also changes.
              </p>

              <p>
                If current of the same size flows in the same direction in two
                electric wires placed side by side, two things happen. The two
                magnetic fields generated in the two wires are combined to form
                one large magnetic field. This also works for more than two
                wires. Additionally, a force of attraction is generated that
                causes the two electric wires to attract each other.
              </p>

              <p>
                If currents of the same size flow in the opposite direction, a
                force of repulsion is generated in the wires, and the magnetic
                fields negate each other.
              </p>

              <p>Fleming's left-Hand rule (For Dc Motors)</p>

              <p>
                If a conductor is placed into a magnetic field and current
                flows, force is exerted on the conductor and it moves according
                to Fleming's left- hand rule. When your left hand is bent with
                your thumb up, and your first two fingers making rabbit ears,
                the conductor moves in the direction of your thumb, the magnetic
                field points north to south in the direction of your pointer
                finger, and the current flows in the direction of your middle
                finger. This all happens as a result of a force acting in the
                same direction, and a DC motor turns by using this force.
              </p>

              <p>
                Below, we can see how this works. Good luck! Tbh, I’m having a
                hard time understanding it. Btw, Fleming also has a right hand
                rule, but honestly, this shit is confusing. Did we expect
                magnetism to be simple? Nope, not in the slightest. Anyways,
                let’s move on.
              </p>

              <p>We’re done (...for now)!</p>

              <p>
                Here’s a few additional formulas and areas of study if you’d
                like to further your knowledge:
              </p>

              <p>
                Capacitance Formula: Q = CV, where Q is the charge stored in a
                capacitor, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage across the
                capacitor. This formula explains how charge and voltage relate
                to the capacitance of a capacitor.
              </p>

              <p>
                Inductance Formula: V = L(dI/dt), where V is the voltage across
                an inductor, L is the inductance, and (dI/dt) represents the
                rate of change of current. This formula is essential for
                understanding the behavior of inductors in circuits.
              </p>

              <p>
                Impedance Formula (AC circuits): Z = √(R² + (Xl - Xc)²), where Z
                is the impedance, R is the resistance, Xl is the inductive
                reactance, and Xc is the capacitive reactance. This formula is
                crucial for analyzing AC circuits with both resistive and
                reactive components.
              </p>

              <p>
                Electrical Energy: E = Pt, where E is electrical energy in
                joules, P is power in watts, and t is time in seconds. This
                formula helps in determining the total energy consumed by an
                electrical device over a period.
              </p>

              <p>
                Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: This law states that
                the electromotive force (emf) induced in a closed circuit is
                directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux
                through the circuit. It's the basis for understanding how
                generators produce electricity.
