                      Yeah so we’ve got atoms, which are what they sound like as
                      long as you’ve made it past 7th grade. The organization of
                      a typical atom has a nucleus of protons and neutrons, and
                      electrons orbiting outside, probabilistically located
                      somewhere within different energy levels, or orbitals.
                      Electrons are far less massive (1/1836) than protons. They
                      have higher energy (and thus greater velocity) the farther
                      they are from the nucleus. Electrons have electric
                      potential energy due to their charge, lower when they are
                      closer to the nucleus, and more when they are farther
                      away. Charged particles create an electric field around
                      themselves. This field exerts forces on other charged
                      particles within its influence. The electric potential
                      energy of a charged particle (electron or proton) is
                      determined by its position within this electric field. The
                      energy decreases as the particle moves farther from
                      similarly charged particles and closer to oppositely
                      charged particles. This energy depends on the charge of
                      the particle, the distance between charges, and the
                      strength of the electric field. Electrons exist in
                      discrete energy levels around the nucleus of an atom,
                      which are defined by quantum mechanics. They are most
                      likely found in regions called orbitals, and their precise
                      positions cannot be determined exactly. The electrons
                      moving throughout whatever conducting material are the
                      valence electrons (the same ones which form covalent bonds
                      in other contexts). If current is flowing, some electrons
                      in the outer shells of atoms are moving through the
                      material. Metals overall will still maintain a neutral
                      charge though (almost always, and if not, then it is
                      usually only brief moments that they as a whole are
                      charged). So there are NOT usually more electrons within
                      the metal than could theoretically be captured within all
                      the atoms of the metal. But there very well may be more
                      free electrons than electrons associating with one
                      particular atom. Put another way, while there are more
                      free electrons than protons in a localized region within a
                      metal when an electric field is applied, this does not
                      imply that the entire metal has a net negative charge
                      (static electricity). Electrons continuously move and
                      redistribute themselves as the current flows, but the
                      overall balance of charge within the metal remains neutral
                      (charge conservation).

                <p>
                  Fun fact! You can create a simple battery by placing two different metals (e.g. copper and zinc) in an electrolyte solution (e.g. lemon juice). This can generate a small voltage. But how?
                  
                  Well, where did we leave off again? Right, voltage. We barely mentioned the word before getting swept into subatomic particles. But what is it? How is it initiated? What the fuck are batteries actually?
                  
                  So, voltage is essentially the electric potential energy per unit charge. It represents the electrical potential difference between two points in a circuit. In other words, it's the energy (potential energy) that an electron possesses when it's at a certain point in a circuit.
                  
                  Think of it as the "potential" for an electric charge to do work due to its position in the field. It is a measure of the "push" or force that drives electrons through a conductor (such as a wire or a component). It is often likened to the pressure in a water pipe. It provides the energy needed to move electrons through a circuit. 
                  
                  Higher voltage means more electrical "pressure," which can result in greater current flow. As a final analogy, you can think of voltage like the height difference in a gravitational field. If you have an object at a higher elevation, it has more gravitational potential energy than an object at a lower elevation. Similarly, in an electrical circuit, a higher voltage represents more potential energy for electric charges.
                  
                  For instance, a typical AA battery has a voltage of 1.5 volts, meaning there is a potential difference of 1.5 volts between its positive and negative terminals. A standard car battery typically has around 12 volts. A standard US household electrical outlet provides 120 volts of alternating current (VAC) power. Europe is chillin at 230 volts. 
                  
                  Power lines that transmit electricity over long distances often operate in the hundreds of thousands of volts (kilovolts or kV). Electric Substation facilities handle tens or hundreds of kilovolts, for efficient long-distance electricity transmission. And lastly research particle accelerators used in scientific research can generate extremely high voltages. For example, the Large Hadron (you know what these are!) Collider (LHC) at CERN operates at energies of several teraelectronvolts (TeV), which translates to trillions of volts.
                  
                  “Electric Potential Difference” is used interchangeably with voltage, and it is the measure of how much the electric potential at one point differs from the electric potential at another point. This difference is crucial because it drives the flow of electric charges (electrons) from a higher potential energy point to a lower one. This is what motivates electric charges to move and do work in electrical circuits.
                  
                  So inside a battery, chemical reactions occur which create an excess of electrons at the (negative) cathode and a deficit of electrons at the (positive) anode. Even more confusing than the fact that I can’t use anode to remember negative is the fact that the cathode is only usually negative, and the anode only usually positive. They can be flipped sometimes. Great.
                  
                  In any case, with excess opposing charges at opposite ends of a conductor, nature seeks to balance this charge, so electrons begin to move from the cathode to the anode through an external circuit. Nature seek to balance this charge for all the reasons we explored in Atoms and Electrons, because of the fundamental fact that opposites attract, because of the way electromagnetic fields behave.
                  
                  But how, you might be asking. I know I was. What kinds of chemical reactions take place that cause these charged poles? Well, they are called redox reactions (reduction/oxidation), and they are reactions which have the effect of atoms (or ions) losing or gaining electrons.
                  
                  But what initiates these reactions? What in the physical universe changes when we humans decide we want redox reactions to occur? Well, the initiation of chemical reactions in a battery, specifically the oxidation and reduction reactions, occur due to the inherent properties of the materials used in the battery, and they are initiated by a physical connection between the materials within the battery.
                  
                  Initially, before the circuit is closed, these electrodes are separated, and there is no direct path for electrons to flow between them. Connect the terminals of a battery by attaching a wire or completing a circuit, and now you have a physical connection between the (-) cathode (+) anode.
                  
                  It’s important to note that the materials connecting the two ends must be a suitable conductor, which reminds me that we will have to study materials science (so briefly!) before we can get to electricity.
                  
                  For now we can say that the materials used in the battery have different chemical properties and electron affinities. 
                  
                  This means that one material has a tendency to gain electrons (cathode, reduction) while the other has a tendency to lose electrons (anode, oxidation).
                  
                  So reduction occurs at the cathode. It is negative, hence during reduction, electrons are gained, and a reduction reaction takes place. For example, in a standard galvanic cell with a copper cathode, copper ions (Cu²⁺) gain electrons and turn into solid copper (Cu) metal. 
                  
                  Oxidation occurs at the anode. During oxidation, electrons are lost, and an oxidation reaction takes place. Using the same example, at the anode of a copper-zinc galvanic cell, zinc (Zn) atoms lose electrons and become zinc ions (Zn²⁺).
                  
                  This difference drives the reaction. The electric potential difference (voltage) between the two terminals is a measure of how much electric potential energy per unit charge is available to do work as charges move between them.
                  
                  When you close the circuit (by connecting the wires), electrons can now flow through the wire cathode —> anode. 
                  
                  The anode is hungry for electrons, and the cathode, being reduced and negative, has an express. As electrons move through the wire, they are doing work against the electric force, moving from a region of lower electric potential (negative terminal) to a region of higher electric potential (positive terminal).
                  
                  This is the “current” measured in amperes, and will be the subject of its own study when we finally get to electricity. 
                  
                  This process can continue as long as there is a continuous path for the electrons to move, and as long as the conditions that sustain the chemical reactions in a battery or power source are met. The availability of reactants (chemical substances involved in the chemical reactions) will determine how long the source can supply a voltage. Batteries have a finite capacity, and as the chemical reactions deplete the reactants, the voltage will gradually decrease until the battery is discharged.
                  
                  So now you understand batteries! By the way, we’re getting really close to actually talking about electricity. I mean when you think electricity, you think batteries, amiright? I am so proud.
